## Dell Laptop Display Woes? Here's the Full Manual to Turn It Back On

 We expect our tech products to work every time we turn them on. It’s never more upsetting than seeing a black screen all of a sudden. Everything else seems to work just fine. The fan is spinning, and the indicator light is on. What’s wrong with my screen? Don’t panic. The**Black Screen of Death** is very common, and whatever the cause is, you can fix it with the following methods.

## Why you’re experiencing a black screen issue

 The main cause of the Dell black screen issue is a bad connection between your graphics drivers and your operating system. Another possible cause is a display adapter driver update issue. You may also run into a Black Screen of Death after system updates or installations, which you may need a reinstallation of Windows.

## Try these fixes

1. **[Restart your graphics drivers](#f1)**
2. **[Force shut down your laptop](#f2)**
3. **[Boot into Safe Mode](#f3)**
4. **[Update your graphics driver](#f4)**
5. **[Restart your explorer.exe process](#f5)**
6. **[Repair corrupted system files](#f7)**
7. **[Reset or update the Bios](#f6)**

### Fix 1: Restart your graphics drivers

 Whenever you run into a BSOD problem, you can always try the keyboard shortcut: press**the Windows logo key + Ctrl + Shift + B** at the same time. This hotkey combination will help you restart your PC’s graphics drivers.

 In many cases, your Dell laptop’s black screen error is simply caused by a bad connection between your operating system and monitor. Therefore, you can try the hotkey combination first to reconnect the display.

 If this doesn’t fix your black screen problem, please try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Force shut down your laptop

 Since you can’t restart your Dell laptop the usual way as it gets stuck, here’s what you can do:

1. Disconnect all external devices or peripherals (such as a printer, Bluetooth, or USB devices).
2. Power off your laptop by pressing the Power button for about**10 to 20 seconds** .
3. Disconnect the AC adapter and remove the battery intact.
4. Drain the remaining battery by holding onto the power button for approximately**60 seconds** .
5. Place the battery back in and plug in the charger.
6. Press the Power button to turn on your laptop.

 If your laptop still doesn’t show the display, you might need to boot into Safe Mode to fix it.

### Fix 3: Boot into Safe Mode

 Safe mode allows your computer to run in a basic state. This can help you narrow down the source of your black screen problem and do some basic troubleshooting. Here’s how to do it:

#### 1\. How to enter Safe Mode

* Your Dell laptop should be**off** . If your laptop is on, turn it off.
* Turn on your laptop by pressing the **Power**  button.
* Hold the **Shift key** and tap the **F8 key**  before the Windows logo shows up. Doing so will bring out the**Recovery Mode**  menu.
* If you couldn’t enter Safe Mode on your first attempt, then try again. It may take several attempts before it works so just be patient.
* While in the **Recovery Mode** menu, select **See advanced repair options** \>**Troubleshoot**  \>**Advanced options** \>**Windows Startup Settings**  \>**Restart** .
* After the computer restarts, there’s a list of options. Choose**5** or**F5** to enter Safe Mode with a network connection.

 If everything works out fine in Safe Mode, then the problem is most likely triggered by an outdated graphics driver, third-party applications, or computer virus.

 To get rid of the black screen error, you can try to uninstall the newly installed applications and perform a virus scan. If the black screen still persists, then head to**[Fix 4](#f4)** to update your graphics driver.

#### 2\. Screen still goes black? Connect to an external display

 Press**the Windows logo key + P** to bring up the display list. Try selecting different display options for other attached displays such as a TV or a second monitor. Then press the**P** or**down arrow key** to select a display and then hit**Enter** .

 But if you still can’t see ANYTHING in Safe Mode, you may need to go to**[Fix 6](#f6)** and**[Fix 7](#f7)** to solve your issue.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 A black screen problem may occur if your graphics driver is out of date. To improve computer performance, it’s important to make sure that you always have the latest graphics driver installed.

 You can update your audio driver manually, if you like, by visiting the manufacturer’s website, finding their driver download page, finding the right driver, etc. But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, or you simply don’t have the time, we recommend doing it with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 6: Repair corrupted system files

 When you’re experiencing a BSOD or Black Screen issue, it’s always a critical error, of a non-recoverable nature, that causes the system to “crash”. If you’re able to access the Windows desktop in Safe Mode, try a complete PC scan to determine the cause of the Dell laptop’s black screen. To save the hassle, we recommend using a professional PC repair tool.
