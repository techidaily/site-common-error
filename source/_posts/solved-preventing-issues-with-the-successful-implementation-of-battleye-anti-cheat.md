**_Question :_   _Recently I’ve noticed thatShell Infrastructure Host uses 50-70% of CPU power of my Windows laptop. Even after closing suspect apps, it’s still hogging a large part of CPU resources for hours. How to fix it?_**

 Well, many Windows 10/11 users have reported this issue, so you are not alone. It mostly happens when performing common tasks like viewing photos on an internal or external hard drive or using a slideshow desktop background. Restarting your computer may fix it temporarily, but it reoccurs after a day or two, which can be quite annoying.  
  
 So in this article, we’ll tell you what steps you can follow to fix the Shell Infrastructure Host high CPU usage issue.

## What’s Shell Infrastructure Host?

**Shell Infrastructure Host** , also known as**sihost.exe** , handles the basic graphics UI elements like taskbar transparency, start menu layout, and even your fancy background image. Normally, it’s a quiet teammate, barely using any CPU resources. But like any good teammate, sometimes it stumbles. When that happens, sihost.exe can suddenly start hogging more CPU power than usual, leaving your computer feeling sluggish and unresponsive.

## How to fix Shell Infrastructure Host high CPU usage?

 Given below are the best solutions for Shell Infrastructure Host high CPU usage problem. You might not need to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

 It might seem obvious, but a simple**restart** of your computer can often work wonders. It clears temporary files and resets processes, potentially giving sihost.exe a fresh start.

### Fix 1: Keep Windows up to date

 Microsoft has made an effort to reduce this kind of issue on Windows 10/11, and installing pending Windows updates helped many users solve the problem. So try it first! Here’s how to update Windows to the most recent version:

1. Click**Start** , and select**Settings** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png" border="0">EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe & convert audio to text freely </a>

2. Select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/update-and-security.jpg)
3. Click**Check for updates** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/updates-1.jpg)
4. Update your OS as required, and restart your computer to see if the issue has been resolved.

If Updating your Windows is not helping, move on to the second fix.

### Fix 2: Use a static desktop background

 As stated, Shell Infrastructure Host is closely related to some basic graphical elements in Windows. In some cases, the high CPU usage problem occurs when you’re using a slideshow desktop background. So switching to a static one could be a solution. Here’s how to do it:

1. Click**Start** , and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/start-setting.jpg)
2. Select**Personalization** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/personalization.jpg)
3. In the **Background** field, select **Picture** or **Solid color.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/background1.jpg)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/background-1.jpg)

 If this step still can’t improve the CPU usage, move on to the next method below.

### Fix 3: Use a different photo viewer app

 One of the major causes of the Shell Infrastructure Host high CPU problem is the memory leak issue with the default photo viewer app in Windows. This bug makes sihost.exe query the registry all the time, which leads to the high CPU usage.

 With that being said, using a different Photo viewer software is another easy fix for this issue. Just follow the steps below:

1. Click**Start** , and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/start-setting.jpg)
2. Select**Apps.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/settings-app.jpg)
3. Select**Default apps** , then click**Photos** (which is the default photo viewer app in Windows).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/default-apps.jpg)
4. Switch to another app.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/choose-an-app.jpg)

 Then check if that resolves the issue. If nothing changes, you might need to repair corrupt system files.

 If the issue disappears, congrats! If not, there is one more fix you can try.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 A Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. By doing so, you can determine whether a software (like photo editing apps) is continuously operating in the background and causing high CPU usage. Here’s how you do it:

1. Right-click**Start** button and select**Run** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/start-runn.jpg)
2. Type**msconfig** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/msconfig.jpg)
3. On the **Services**  tab of System Configuration, select **Hide all Microsoft services** , and then select **Disable all** . Click **Apply** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clean-boot2.jpg)
5. On the **Startup** tab in **Task Manager** , for **each** startup item, select the item and then click **Disable** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clean-boot5.jpg)
8. Check to see if the problem goes away.

 Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, but that functionality will return when you[reset the computer to start normally](#reset) .

**Find out the app or service that causes the issue**

 If the Shell Infrastructure Host CPU resource hogging issue doesn’t occur in a clean boot environment, you need to find out which startup application or service is causing the problem:

 Enable the disabled services one at a time and restart the computer. If the issue reappears after enabling one of them, you need to uninstall this problematic software in order to resolve this issue.

 But note that the most efficient way to do this is to test half of them at a time, thus eliminating half of the items as the potential cause with each reboot of the computer. You can then repeat this process until you’ve isolated the problem.

 **Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting**

 After you finish troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start normally.

1. Right-click**Start** button and select**Run** .
2. Type**msconfig** and press**Enter** .
3. On the **General**  tab, select **Normal startup** .

6. In Task Manager, Enable all of the startup programs you had Disabled before, and then select **OK** .
7. When you’re prompted to restart the computer, select **Restart** .
