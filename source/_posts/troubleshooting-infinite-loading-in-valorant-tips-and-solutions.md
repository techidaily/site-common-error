## Troubleshooting Persistent Booting Problems: Solutions Inside

 Your computer gets stuck on the boot screen? This is very annoying – and quite scary. You’re probably thinking, I can’t even access the desktop! How am I supposed to fix it? But no worries, you can fix this. Here’s what you can do…

## How to Fix the PC Stuck on Boot Screen Issue

* [Solution 1: Boot your PC without Peripherals](#h-solution-1-boot-your-pc-without-peripherals)
* [Solution 2: Check the RAM](#h-solution-2-check-the-ram)
* [Solution 3: Reset BIOS Settings](#h-solution-3-reset-bios-settings)

* [Solution 5: Repair Corrupted System Files](#h-solution-5-repair-corrupted-system-files)
* [Solution 6: Perform a Fresh Install](#h-solution-6-perform-a-fresh-install)

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

## Solution 1: Boot your PC without Peripherals

 External peripherals can sometimes conflict with your system and trigger errors of all sorts. So before we dive into anything deeper, let’s start with the easiest solution: restarting your PC without peripherals.

**1)**  Press and hold the **power button**  until your computer turns off.

**2)**  Disconnect all **peripherals**  (your printer, scanner, webcam, mouse, etc.).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/usb-g6d352e3ca_640.jpg)

**3)**  Try turning on your computer again.

 If your computer boots correctly, that means that one of the peripherals you removed is causing your problem. You should **reinstall each device** back into your computer and test them each time. Then, you’ll find the specific device that causes your problem. Replace the device once you’ve identified it. Or, consult the manufacturer of the device for assistance.

If your computer still can’t boot correctly, try the fix below.

## Solution 2: Check the RAM

 Your computer might be unresponsive during the startup process when your RAMs are not well installed, or in some cases, one or more of your RAM modules or RAM slots is faulty.

 1) Press and hold the**power button** until your computer turns off.

 2) Open your computer case.

 This process will vary depending on different types of computers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult your computer’s documentation or seek professional help.

3) On your motherboard, remove your RAMs from the memory slots.

RAM looks like this:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Put your RAMs back into the slot one by one while trying to boot each time.

 If your computer starts without one or more of the RAMs, then it could be an issue with your RAM modules. Or in some cases, it is possible that your RAM module is fine, but one or more memory slots on your motherboard are defective. You may want to try removing the modules and placing them in different slots to find if one of the slots is faulty.

 If your computer still can’t boot properly, don’t worry. Check the fix below.

## Solution 3: Reset BIOS Settings

 When you’re booting up your computer, BIOS instructs it on how to boot up the operating system. And improper BIOS settings can cause computer boot issues.

 You can reset your BIOS settings back to it’s original to see if that’s the issue for you. Here is how to do it:

1) Press and hold the power button until your computer turns off.

2) Disconnect the AC power cord from the power supply, and then open your computer case.

3) On your motherboard, remove your CMOS battery with your fingernail or a non-conductive screwdriver.

The CMOS battery looks like this

1) Boot your computer into safe mode.

2) Type **recovery**  in the search box on your desktop, and click **Recovery** in the list of results.

## Solution 5: Repair Corrupted System Files

 Computer boot issues are likely to occur when certain system files get corrupted somehow. To see if there’s any broken or missing system files, there are two tool you can use：

* **[Option 1 – Fortect (Recommend)](#h-repair-system-files-with-reimage)**  Use the Windows repair tool Fortect to fully analyze your computer environment and identify the cause of the monitor issues. This will deal with issues related to system errors and critical system files.
* **[Option 2 – Windows System File Checker](#h-run-system-file-checker)**  Use Windows built-in tool System File Checker to check for corrupt, damaged system files and repair them. However, this can only help you fix issues related to major system files, and it won’t be able to help with issues caused by damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

 To proceed, you’ll need to boot your PC into safe mode. If you don’t know how to do it, you can check our guide on **[How to start Windows 10 in Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Repair System Files with Fortect**

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  specializes in Windows repair. It will fully scan your system environment and replace corrupted and deleted files with fresh Windows files from its updated online database.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan of your PC status. This may take a few minutes.

 3) You can review a summary of the issues detected after the scan is finished.
