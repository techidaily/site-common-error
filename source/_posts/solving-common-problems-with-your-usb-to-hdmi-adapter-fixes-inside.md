 When you are playing PS4 games, you may have problems chatting on line with other people in the party chat. And you find the**PS4 NAT Type Failed** when you are testing the Internet connection. Don’t worry! There are**fixes to the PS4 NAT Type failed problem** .

 This article introduces 4 methods to**solve the PS4 NAT type failed issue** . Try the following methods. You don’t need to try them all; just work your way through until your problem is solved.

**Note** : before getting started, be sure that your network works properly, including your router, modem and all the cables. You can try your network on another device to see if it works or not.

[**Method 1: Manually configure the PS4 network settings**](#Method1)
[**Method 2: Enable UPnP for your router**](#Method2)

## **What is PS4 NAT type?**

 NAT stands for**Network Address Translation** , which represents the ability to**translate a public IP address to a private IP address** , and vice versa. In PS4 games, it tells the ease or difficulty of connecting to other PS4 systems, especially when you are using the communication features, like the party chat.

There are 3 types of NAT in your PS4:

**Type 1 (Open)** : The system is directly connected to the Internet (no router or firewall), and you should have no problems connecting to other PS4 systems.

**Type 2 (Moderate)** : The system is connected through a router properly, and generally you won’t have problems.

**Type 3 (Strict)** : The system is connected through a router without open ports or DMZ setup, and you may have problems related with the connection or voice chat.

 The NAT type failed normally because of the**network issues** , such as the**incorrect network settings** or the**network firewall problems** . Changing NAT Type can be an effective method to improve your PS4 network status. At present, you can’t manage the NAT type status directly by your PS4 settings, and you need to change the NAT type by the router settings.

## **Method 1: Manually configure the PS4 network settings**

 The PS4 NAT type failed issue can be caused by the incorrect network setting in your PS4, so you can check if your PS4 IP address changed or not. Furthermore, you can manually configure the network settings in your PS4 to make it correct.

## **Method 2: Enable UPnP for your router**

 If manually configuring the network settings doesn’t work for you, you can try to**enable UPnP for your router** . UPnP stands for**Universal Plug and Play** , which allows the devices on a network to discover each other.

 Enabling UPnP in your router can help improve the connection when you are playing games and chatting with other people. Follow these steps:

**Note** : Here we take the TP-link router as an example, but the fixes apply to all the routers.

 1) Go and see the**IP address** ,**Username** and**Password** on your wireless router (you will see that on the stick of your router, or find the information on the manual).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a548ca181e7d.png)

 2) Open your**browser** on PC or mobile phone, then type the**IP address** in your browser, and press**Enter** .

 3) Type your**Username** and**Password** , then**login** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e42f8c2f134.jpg)

 4) Go to**Advanced** \>**Forwarding** , and you will see**UPnP** . (Or you can find the UPnP section in other tab according to the different routers.)

 5)**Turn UPnP on** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a548dc97186b.jpg)

 6) Click**Apply/Save** to save your settings.

 7)**Reboot** your router and wait for it to connect.

 8) Go to PS4**Settings** \>**Network** \>**Test Internet Connection** , and check if your**NAT Type** is on (you’ll see the type 1 or type 2 since it’s on).

## **Method 3: Make your PS4 the DMZ server**

 DMZ means**Demilitarized Zone** , which is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains an organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network.

 This can help you correct the network configurations on your router, and improve your network performance if the settings are properly checked. (Some people may worry about causing security problems by this method, but it’s OK since you are using the network at your home instead of in the public.)

 1) Go and see the**IP address** ,**Username** and**Password** on your wireless router.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a548ca181e7d.png)

 2) Open your**browser** on PC or mobile phone, then type the**IP address** in your browser, and press**Enter** .

 3) Type your**Username** and**Password** , then**login** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e42f8c2f134.jpg)

 4) Go to**Advanced** \>**Forwarding** , and you’ll see**DMZ** on the left. (Or you can find the DMZ section in other tab according to the different routers.)

 5) Click**Enable** to**enable DMZ** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a548e4dac329.png)

 6) Change the**IP address** to match with the IP address in your PS4\. (If you don’t know your PS4 IP address, click[**here**](#Step1) to know how to check.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a548e65a013a.png)

 7) If you are using routers that has the**NAT Filtering** option, such as NETGEAR router, you can also click to**open NAT filtering** . (You can skip to the next step if you don’t have this option.)

 8) Click**Apply/Save** to save your settings.

 9) Reboot your routers and wait for it to connect.

 10) Go to PS4**Settings** \>**Network** \>**Test Internet Connection** , and check if your**NAT Type** is on (you’ll see the Type 1 or Type 2 if it works).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a5488dd7df5a.jpg)

 This may get all the network traffic to your PS4 and reduce the network restrictions when using your PS4.

## **Method 4: Forward Port for your PS4 network**

 Ports forwarding, also referred to**ports mapping** , redirects a**communication request** from one address and port number to another while packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router. You can improve the connection performance by forwarding the ports.

**Note** : Please make sure your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn’t have the Carrier-Grade-NAT before you try this method. If your ISP has the Carrier-Grade-NAT, you may fail to configure and have to choose NAT Type 3.

 1) Go and see the**IP address** ,**Username** and**Password** on your wireless router.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a548ca181e7d.png)

 2) Open your**browser** on PC or mobile phone, then type the**IP address** in your browser, and press**Enter** .

 3) Type your**Username** and**Password** , then**login** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e42f8c2f134.jpg)

 4) Go to the**forward ports section** (or**ports forwarding** ,**Virtual Server** ,**Applications**  according to different routers).

 5)**Add the custom forwarding ports** . You can try the following ports recommended by Sony:

80(TCP), 443(TCP), 3478(TCP and UDP), 3479(TCP and UDP), 3480(TCP)

**Note** : you should give a name and assign your PS4 IP address to each of these ports. (If you don’t know how to check your PS4 IP address, click[**here**](#Step1) .)

 6)**Apply/Save** your changes.

 7) Go to PS4**Settings** \>**Network** \>**Test Internet Connection** , and check your**NAT Type** .
