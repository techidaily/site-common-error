7. Try to launch Internet Explorer, and it should respond normally now.

 If it isn’t successful, there may be something wrong with the Internet Explorer files.

### Tip 3: Run System File Checker

 As Internet Explorer is a built-in browser, corrupted system files could cause IE not responding properly. Then you can use **System File Scanner**  to run a scan.

**System File Checker** will inspect all of the important Windows files on your PC. If the Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace it.

1. Type **cmd**   in the Windows search box.
2. **Right-click**  on **Command Prompt**  and select **Run as administrator**  .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97756bba070.jpg)
4. Once Command Prompt is open, type the **sfc /scannow**  command and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
**Note:**  There’s a space between **sfc**  and **/scannow**  .

5. When the verification reaches 100%, you’ll see something like this if issues were found and corrected:  
 **Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.**  
 If that’s the case, restart your PC.
6. Check if you can open IE normally.

1. Right-click on the Taskbar and select**Task Manager** .

1. Type **restore** in the Windows search box and select **Create a restore point**  or **System Restore** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977ba6da9ba.jpg)
