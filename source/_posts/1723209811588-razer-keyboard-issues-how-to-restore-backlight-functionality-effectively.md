### Fix 1: Plug your keyboard in another USB port

 It‚Äôs probably caused by the poor connection. Plug your keyboard into another USB port and check if it does light up. If it does and everything works well, it‚Äôs your USB port that has the issue.  
 If it doesn‚Äôt light up, move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Uninstall and reinstall Razer Synapse

 Plug your keyboard into another computer to see it light up or not. If it doesn‚Äôt light up, it might be a hardware problem and you need to contact Razer support.  
 If it does, the problem might be caused by your Razer Synapse. Then a full reinstall of Synapse can help you solve the problem.

1. Unplug your keyboard.
2. Uninstall Synapse.
3. Press**Windows key + R** together to open the Run box.
4. Type ‚Äúservice.msc‚Äù and press**Enter** to open Windows Services. Make sure all Razer services listed are stopped.
