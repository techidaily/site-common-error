### Fix 1: Disable Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Google Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on  blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If one of your add-ons is faulty, or for some reason conflicts with your browser or your other add-ons, it can cause the**Shockwave Flash has crashed**  issue.

 To see if this is your problem, you need to temporarily disable all your add-ons, then check if the problem is resolved. If it is, itâ€™s likely that one of your add-ons is causing the problem, and you simply need to figure out which one. Hereâ€™s how to do this:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b432bba1ea5a.jpg)
3. Toggle off all the extensions on your Chrome.

4. Re-launch Chrome, play the same content and see if it works smoothly.  
 If yes, you can try to enable the extensions one by one until you find out the one responsible. But if it doesnâ€™t help with the situation, you might want to turn on the extensions and move on to **Fix 2** .

### Fix 2: Disable hardware acceleration

**Hardware Acceleration**  is a feature in  browsers  that tasks GPU with all the graphics and text rendering, hence giving us a better video playing and watching experience.

 But sometimes itâ€™s also the culprit of this**Shockwave Flash has crashed/not responding** issue. So we can disable the feature to see if the problem gets fixed:

1. In Chrome, in the top right corner, click on  the **three vertical dots**  button >   **Settings**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581a513db47.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Advanced** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b582452d2feb.png)
3. Scroll down to the bottom and in **System**  and **DISABLE** the toggle next to **Use hardware acceleration when available** .

4. Re-launch Chrome and test if the video content loads without fail this time.
