### Fix 2: Close unused apps and set high priority for PUBG

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Esc**   at the same time to open **Task Manager** .
2. Right-click on the programs you donâ€™t need to run at the moment and click **End task** .

3. After that, we can also prioritize PUBG. Click the**Details** tab, right-click on your**PUBG** and click**Set priority** \>**High** .
4. Start a game in PUBG and see if the lag issues have been fixes. If the issue persists, please move on to**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Lower your game resolution

Running PUBG in a lower resolution can also help in fixing lag:

1. Create a shortcut of your PUBG, then right-click on the**shortcut** and click**Properties** .
2. Under the **Shortcut** tab, in **Target** field, leave**a space** and type**resolution:** **the resolution of your preference** (1024Ã—768 for example).
3. Start a game in PUBG and check if the lag in PUBG issues have been resolved. If yes, then congrats! But if the issues still persist, you should move on to**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics drivers

 The PUBG lag problem may also occur if youâ€™re using the wrong or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

### Fix 5: Change the power option and adjust for best performance

 By default, the power plan on our computer is often configured to **Balanced**   or **Power saver**   to conserve battery, which largely compromises the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Also the system performance on our computer may also be undermined for the advanced graphics features.

So to tweak the settings:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4e6c91572.png)
2. Choose the **High performance** option.
