 The error can be caused by hardware issues. So first, follow below simple instructions to do the troubleshooting.

**1\. Try the device on a different USB port.** This will figure out if the problem is caused by a broken port.
  
 2\. Connect the device to another PC. This will figure out if the external device has a problem.
