**2)**  Press the**volume up (+) button** and the**power button** together and**hold** them for around**15** **seconds** . (Do**NOT** release them when you see the logo pops up.)

**3)**  Leave your Surface Pro 4 for over**10** **seconds** .

**4) Start** your device. Then try your touch screen and see if it can work.

## Method 3: Update the driver of your touch screen
