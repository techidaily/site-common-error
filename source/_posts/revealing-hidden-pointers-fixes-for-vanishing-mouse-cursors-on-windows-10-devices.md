## Method 1: Run troubleshooter

 Windows has built-in troubleshoot to fix the common error in the operating system. This issue may due to hardware conflicts. To solve the problem, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Here’s how:

1. Type “troubleshoot” in the search bar and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/8.23.1.jpg)
2. Find**Hardware and Devices** then click.
3. Click**Run the troubleshooter** .

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Relaunch your computer and check the issue is resolved or not.

 If you fail to find Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in Control Panel, that’s probably because your computer version is after **Windows 10 build 1809** . The version has removed the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Don’t worry, you can still run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in this way:

1. Right-click on the**Start** button, then click**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .

2. Copy and paste**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the PowerShell, then press the**Enter** key.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
