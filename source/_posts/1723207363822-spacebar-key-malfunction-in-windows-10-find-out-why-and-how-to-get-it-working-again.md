### Fix 2: Enable the NumLock key

 Look on your keyboard for a key that says **NumLock** and make sure to enable the key.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd2eecb19e08.jpg)

 If the**NumLock** key is disabled, the number keys on the right side of your keyboard will not work.

 If the NumLock key is enabled and the number keys still don’t work, you can try pressing the NumLock key for about**5 seconds** , which did the trick for some users.

### Fix 3: Update your keyboard driver

 A missing or outdated keyboard driver may also stop keyboard numbers from working.

 There are two ways to update your keyboard driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** — You can update your keyboard driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact keyboard model and your version of Windows.

**Automatic driver update** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your keyboard driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd2ebe32f70f.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to your keyboard to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 4: Use a different user profile

 Keyboard numbers not working might be a symptom of user profile corruption. To check for it, you can try logging in to Windows with a different user account.

 If you only have one account, you can click the**Start** button >**Settings** \>**Accounts** \>**Family & other users** \>**Add someone else to this PC** to create a local account.

 When you’ve logged in to Windows with the new account, open Word or Notepad to test your keyboard numbers.

### Fix 5: Check hardware issues

 If you’ve tried all of the steps above and the number keys on your keyboard are still not working, it’s likely that the keyboard is defective. You can connect your keyboard to a different PC to check hardware issues.
