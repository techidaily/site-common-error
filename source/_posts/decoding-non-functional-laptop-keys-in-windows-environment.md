## Troubleshooting Nonfunctional USB Ports on Windows 10/11 - Fixed

 If you find one of your USB devices on Windows 10 isn’t working, read on. Whether it’s a USB mouse, keyboard, pen drive, printer, or some other USB devices altogether, this guide should resolve your problem.

 Note that there are 5 possible solutions here. You may not need to try them all; just start at the top of the list and work your way down.

## **Method 1: Check if the device itself is faulty**

 If the USB device was working before you upgraded to Windows 10, it’s unlikely to be faulty. But coincidences do occur. It’s certainly_possible_ that your device just happened to die right at the same time that you upgraded Windows. So it’s best to rule that possibility out for sure before spending time on more complex troubleshooting.

 To check if the USB device is faulty, simply unplug it (‘Eject’ it if it’s a USB storage device) and plug it into another computer. If it works, the device is fine. If it doesn’t, then you’ve isolated the problem! You just need to buy a replacement.

## **Method 2: Check your power supply (laptop only)**

 Your laptop’s power supply delivers power to your USB ports. If, for some reason, it fails to do this properly, the devices plugged into those USB ports may stop working. Sometimes, this can be fixed quite simply:

1) Unplug the power supply and charger plug from your laptop

2) Restart your laptop

3) Connect your USB device to the laptop again

4) Plug the power supply back in

## **Method 3: Check your power management settings**

 In order to save power, by default, Windows switches your USB controllers off when they’re not in use, and switches them back on again when they’re needed. Unfortunately, sometimes this approach doesn’t work as intended, and Windows fails to switch your USB controllers on again.

 To rule this out as the cause of your USB woes, just stop Windows from ‘managing’ power to your USB controllers and devices:

 1) Open Device Manager (type “Device Manager” in the Windows search field)

 2) Expand the**Universal Serial Bus controllers** branch

 3) Double-click the first **USB Root Hub** device in the list (if you see only one USB Root Hub device, that’s fine)

 4) Click the **Power Management**  tab

5) Un-check the **Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power**  checkbox, and click **OK** .

## **Method 4: Check your USB device drivers**

 Your USB ports not working problem is probably being caused by driver issues. The steps above may resolve it, but if they don’t, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

## **Method 5: Check your USB ports**

 If none of the above methods resolve your problem, your USB ports might be damaged. To find out, you can take your PC to a repair store and ask them to check. If your USB ports are damaged, the repairer should be able to replace them fairly inexpensively.
