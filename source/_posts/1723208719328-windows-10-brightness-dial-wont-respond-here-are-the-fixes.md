## Solution 1: Update your display driver

There are two ways you can update your display driver : manually or automatically. **Manual driver update –** You can update your display driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your display card  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. **Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your display driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact display card, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
