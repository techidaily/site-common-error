### Fix 5: Try another port

 Before reconnecting your**Logitech G930** to your computer, make sure it’s**FULLY CHARGED** and**POWERED OFF** .

 If the fixes above didn’t solve the problem for you, then you can try connecting your Logitech G930 headset to another port and see if it works.

 For example, if you were using the USB 3.0 port, then switch to a USB 2.0 port; if you were using a USB hub, then connect the headset receiver to the PC USB port to see if it works.

 If all else fails, then it’s probably a hardware issue. You should contact **[Logitech Support](https://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/contact-support)**  for further troubleshooting.
