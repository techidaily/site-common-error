### Fix 1: Identify the cause of the problem

 To see what’s going on and find the solution, you should identify the reason of the error.

 If the servers for Dragon Ball FighterZ are down, or under maintenance, you, and everyone else who’s playing the game, will receive this error and can’t play the game currently. So you can contact the Dragon Ball FighterZ support and see if that’s the case. if so, there’s nothing you can do but just wait for the servers on line. Since the developers won’t inform you when the problem has been resolved, you should check periodically and see if it works.

 If other people can log in and play the game without problems, it seems the cause lies in your computer. You can choose another region and see if you can play the same. If that’s unavailable, or that didn’t fix your problem, it means that you need to do something in your PC. Then go to[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
