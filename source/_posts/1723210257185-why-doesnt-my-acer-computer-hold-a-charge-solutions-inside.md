### Fix 1: Perform some basic hardware troubleshooting

 The battery not charging issue doesn’t always happen because of software or system issue, but the apparent little details that we could all neglect.

Here are a few basic checks you should do to rule this out as a cause:

1) Make sure you have connected your laptop to a working power socket.

2) Make sure the cables are plugged in firmly.

3) Ensure that the battery is properly seated in its compartment and that there is no issues with the laptop contact points and the battery.

4) Check to see if there is any dust inside the charging port. If yes, use a piece of clean and dry cloth to wipe it off.

5) Check if your laptop is overheating. If yes, then remove the battery, leave it for a couple of minutes to cool it off and put it back in. To take better care of the battery, it’s also recommended that you get a cooling fan for your laptop, or move it to a well-ventilated place.

 All checked but battery is still not charging? Please move on to**Fix 2** , below.
