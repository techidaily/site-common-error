## Should You Preserve msdia80.dll in Windows? Find Out Why

Are you trying to install an application but receive an error message? Or are you cleaning your disk to free some space but get confused about the msdia80.dll? Don’t worry, this post will explain it to you.

## What is msdia80.dll?

 First, you don’t need to worry. Because this file is not a virus. This file is a system file in Visual C++2005 Redistributable Package. If your computer is running a 64-bit operating system, and you’ve installed the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package, the msdia80.dll will be installed in the root folder of the boot drive.

 If you’ve tried to delete it, you may find it comes back automatically. The msdia80.dll file is a DLL file, short for Dynamic Link Library. In the Windows system, many applications are not a complete executable, they’re split into relatively independent DLL files. When you run a program, the corresponding DLL file will be called. A program can call multiple DLL files and one DLL file can be used by different programs. These DLL files are known as shared DLL files.

## Should we keep it or not?

 While it’s no harm to keep it because it’s a safe system file. But this file should be located at**C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\VC\\msdia80.dll** . If you find it in other drives, you may need to be careful cause it could be the reason for the unsuccessful installation for your other application.
