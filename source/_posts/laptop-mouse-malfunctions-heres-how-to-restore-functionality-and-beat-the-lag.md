### Fix 1: Check for physical issues

Depending on which mouse isn’t working:

* If it’s the touchpad mouse, then move on to**Fix 2** .

2. Move your mouse and check if the **mouse frozen on laptop** issue has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if the problem persists, move on to**Fix 3** , below.
