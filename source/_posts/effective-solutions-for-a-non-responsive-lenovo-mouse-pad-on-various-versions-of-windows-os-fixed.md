### Fix 2: Update your touchpad driver

 Another major culprit for a **not-working-lenovo-touchpad**   is your outdated/corrupt/wrong/missing touchpad driver. You might need to **update your touchpad driver**   to get your touchpad up and running again.

 Thereâ€™re two ways you can update your device drivers â€”

**Update your drivers manually** â€“ You can update your**touchpad driver** manually by going to the**Lenovo** â€™s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** â€“  If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your **touchpad** **driver** manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either[**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
