But the good news is, this is not a difficult issue to resolve.

### Fix 3: Use the Ethernet connection

It’s recommended to use the Ethernet connection, since playing games like Destiny 2 requires a more stable and faster Internet connection. So you can switch to the**Ethernet connection**on your computer to see if it works. If you want to use the WiFi connection, or there’s no Ethernet connection available, try these steps to force your computer (and Destiny 2 included) to connect via WiFi.

1. Right click on the**network icon** at the bottom right corner on your desktop, and click**Open Network and Sharing Center** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f04abb90727.png) If you don’t see “**Open Network and Sharing Center** ” there, you can click**Open Network and Internet settings** , then click**Network and Sharing Center** in**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ade913312.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae1eb2cb9.jpg)
2. Click**Change adapter settings** on the left.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae4f8eabf.jpg)
3. Right click on the**connections** that you’re not using, and select**Disable** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9b0540f4ac.jpg)  
 You’ll need to repeat this step for any other connections that you’re not using.

4. Now your computer will only use the connection via WiFi. Restart the game and see if it works.
Still no luck? Ok, there’s one more thing to try.
