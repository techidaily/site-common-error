1. Turn off your keyboard.

3. While holding down the ESC key, turn on your keyboard and wait for a few seconds until the keyboard begins to flash.

 If your keyboard still doesn’t light up after the resetting, don’t give up and try the next fix below.

## Fix 2: Update the Corsair keyboard driver

 This lighting problem may occur if you are using**the wrong keyboard driver or it’s out of date** . So you should check if there’s any updated version of your Corsair keyboard driver and upgrade to it to see if the backlight problem can be fixed.

 You can update your drivers manually by going to[**the Corsair website**](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fdownloads&mktsrc=drivereasyen%5F167630) , downloading the driver installer for your keyboard and installing it step by step.  
 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the**Scan Now** button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click**Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## Fix 3: Update and configure the iCUE software

 iCUE is a software that allows you to control the performance of Corsair’s devices. Updating the iCUE software may help you deal with bugs that relate to your backlight problem. Here is how:

 If you haven’t installed it before, just go to the[**iCUE download page**](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Ficue&mktsrc=drivereasyen%5F167630) and follow the setup wizard to install the latest version of iCUE first.

1. Open iCUE and click the**Settings** tab.

4. In the ICUE settings pane,**uncheck** the box next to**Enable SDK** .

 (SDK stands for Software Development Kit. In iCUE, it allows some programs to control the lighting of devices. Therefore unchecking the Enable SDK option may also help to resolve your backlight not working issue.)
