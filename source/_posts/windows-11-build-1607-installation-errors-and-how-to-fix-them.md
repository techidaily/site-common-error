**6)** Try connecting your Bluetooth devices to test your problem.

If your issue continues to occur, then try the next solution, below.

### Fix 4: Update Bluetooth driver

 You might run into this issue when you’re using a faulty Bluetooth driver, or the driver is outdated. Try updating your Bluetooth driver to see if that’s the problem for you.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your Bluetooth: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your Bluetooth, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
