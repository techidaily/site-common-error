### Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before we make any changes, we might have to troubleshoot hardware issues. To do so:

1. Make sure to check your**Astro A40** headset for loose cables or the wrong jack.
2. Try connecting your**Astro A40** to a different port and see if this fixes the problem.

 Check if the microphone is still not working. If yes, then great. But if it’s not working, move on to **Fix 2** , below.

---

### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes the mic on A40 won’t work simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

1. Click **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider**  all the way  to at least halfway up.

 If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.
2. Test if your A40 headset is working properly. If not, then move on to **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally when a new audio device is inserted, Windows will automatically set it as the default audio playback device. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

1. Right-click on  **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click  **Sounds**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd832a7341af.jpg)
2. Click the**Recording** tab, then click on **your microphone device** and click**Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd83abdc9c8c.jpg)  
 If**no microphone devices shows up in the device list** , then right-click on**the empty space** and tick**Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on**the microphone device** once it appears and click**Enable** before you do step**2)** .
3. Click on**your microphone device** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd83e5d33881.jpg)
4. Click the**Levels** tab, then drag**the Microphone slider** all the way to_its top_ and click**OK** .

5. Click**OK** to apply the changes in the windows.
6. Now with microphone set as default device and the volume turned up, try playing some audio on your A40 headset and see if it works. If it does, then the **Astro A40 mic not working** problem is solved. If no, don’t worry. There’s one more fix for you to try.
