## Regular Inspections: Periodically Check Your Vehicle for Signs of Wear and Tear on the Suspension Components Such as Shock Absorbers, Springs, Bushes, Ball Joints, and Control Arms. If You Notice Any Unusual Noises or a Change in the Car's Ride Height or Handling Characteristics, It Might Be Time for an Inspection by a Professional Mechanic

The**80240020** error happens usually when the Windows 10 files that you downloaded was not complete and the setup process still tried to do the upgrade to Windows 10\. Or it could be that your Windows 10 installation folder is unfinished or corrupted.

Luckily, this is an easy question to solve. Please follow the steps below to get this problem fixed. **Step One**1) Navigate to**C:\\$Windows.\~BT**folder. If you cannot see this folder, please make sure that you have checked the hidden items.

Delete as many files in this folder as you can. You might not be able to delete all the files due to permission issues. 2) Navigate to**C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download** and delete all the files in this folder. Please note that you don’t have to delete**Download**folder, but rather, you need to delete the content in it.

3) Type**cmd.exe**in the search box in**Start**panel and right click the option**cmd**and choose**Run as administrator**. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/run-as-administrator.jpg)Click**Yes**at this prompt.

Refer to this post to see[**how to backup and restore your registry**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). 1) Press**Windows key**and**R**at the same time, then type in**regedit**and hit**Enter**.

 Your**Windows Update** panel should come out in a couple of seconds. If it won’t open automatically, you can open this panel from Control Panel manually. Then, you should be able to download your Windows 10 from scratch.

The steps above also work if you are having a**80080080** or **8024600A**  error code. Usually the error is common with Windows 8.1 users, but for those who are using Windows 7, this solution applies as well. If the problem still persists, please be patient, Windows update takes time to download the upgrades in the background. If you still could not get this problem fixed, your Windows update tool might be corrupted so the security settings and background process is now malfunctioned. In this case, it is suggested that you burn the DVD or CD or USB flash drive with Windows 10 ISO files in to do the clean install from scratch. If you want to know how to do it, please refer to[this post here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for more information.
