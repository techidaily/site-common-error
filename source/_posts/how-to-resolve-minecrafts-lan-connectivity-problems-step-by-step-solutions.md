### Method 1: Update your graphics card driver

 The OpenGL errors in Minecraft relates to your graphics card driver. Corrupted or outdated graphics card driver will result in Minecraft not working problem, including the OpenGL error popups. So you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

Two options to update your graphics card driver:

* **Option 1** – You can manually update your video driver by searching the latest driver on the website of the manufacturer, then download and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.
* **Option 2** – If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to your flagged graphics card to automatically download the latest correct driver (you can do this with the**Free** **version** ), then manually install it in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**_Update All_** ).

4) Restart Windows to take effect.

Now launch Minecraft and see if it stops popping up the OpenGL error.

### Method 2: Turn off OpenGL in Minecraft

 OpenGL is enabled by default in your game, so as to provide you with the best gaming experience. However, some graphics cards don’t render the OpenGL feature. In these circumstances, you’ll see the Minecraft OpenGL errors. So you can turn off OpenGL for Minecraft to stop that error.

Here’s what to do:

 1) In Minecraft, click**Options** \>**Video Settings** .

 2) Click the**Advanced OpenGL** setting, and turn it**OFF** .

3) Save the change and restart Minecraft.

Hopefully OpenGl errors stop happening again.

### Method 4: Temporarily disable Mods

 Using mods for Minecraft may cause OpenGL errors occuring in your game, as some mods may be incompatible with OpenGL. So you can temporarily disable mods for Minecraft and see if OpenGL errors stop occurring.

 If OpenGL errors stop popping up, then you should find the culprit – mods. You can disable your mods one by one to troubleshoot which mod causes your problem.

 If OpenGL errors still persist, mods aren’t your problem and ensure to re-enable mods later on.

### Method 5: Modify graphics settings in your game

You can modify graphics settings by following steps below:

 1) In Minecraft, click**Options** \>**Video Settings** .

 2) Modify settings like**VBOs** ,**Render Region** , and**Clear Water** . If the option is already**ON** , set it to**OFF** .

3) Modify each setting one by one and check if Minecraft error stops.

 If you can’t access Minecraft video settings, you can modify these options in the configuration file under Minrcraft folder.

 There is a file named**_options.txt_** that’s stored the changeable options in Minecraft. This file is located in the Minecraft folder on your computer. You can edit the settings in this**_options.txt_** file and save your changes.

 If you’re not sure which option can be edited, check **[this post](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Options.txt)**  on Minecraft for more details.

### Method 6: Install the latest Java version

 Minecraft is a game developed from Java, so Java files are critical to play Minecraft. If Java version is outdated in your computer, you’re likely to have the OpenGL error.

 Usually Minecraft will include the Java files when downloading Minecraft. So you can uninstall Minecraft then reinstall Minecraft to have the latest compatible Java package files.

 Or you can manually download Java files from **[this page](https://java.com/en/download/win10.jsp)**  , then follow the on-screen instructions to finish installing.

 Once installed, re-launch Minecraft and see if OpenGL errors has been fixed.
