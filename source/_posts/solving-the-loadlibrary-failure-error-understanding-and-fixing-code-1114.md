## 5) Perform a Clean Boot

 If you have tried some methods and the issue persists, you need to check if there is any application that is interfering with Windows Update.

 To do so, you need to put your operating system in clean boot state — that is, to start your system with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This method can help you identify exactly which application is causing trouble.

**a)** Press**Windows logo key** and**R key** on your keyboard at the same time to open**Run** dialog. In this dialog, type “_**msconfig**_ ” and hit**Enter** . This will open System Configuration window.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59802fed6d846.png)

**b)**  On**General** tab in System Configuration window, you can see the default setting is**Normal startup** . Now you need to select **Selective startup** and**untick Load startup items** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_598030b608b16.jpg)

**c)**  Go to**Services** tab. Tick**Hide all Microsoft services** . Then click on**Disable all** . (You need to hide all Microsoft services first, or you will disable some secure services and bring about unexpected consequences.) After that click**OK** .

**d)**  Restart your computer, and it will boot into clean boot state. Check and see whether you can download updates with Windows Update. If you can, refer to the steps above to**enable** **the services one by one** to identify which application is the culprit. After that, you can disable or uninstall the problematic program, or find an alternative in order to prevent the issue.

 \* Note that after finishing troubleshooting, you need to**revert** your changes to the settings above to the original ones.
