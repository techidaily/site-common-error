## **Fix 0x800704cf error when connecting to a network PC**

![Fix 0x800704cf error when connecting to a network PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/case1.jpg)

 It’s very frustrating when you want to access another network PC to share files or perform specific tasks but are interrupted by the 0x800704cf error. No worries. You can follow the guide below to put things back on track.

1. **[Change adapter options](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Reset TCP/IP](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Reinstall the network adapter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 The screenshot below comes from Windows 10, but the fixes also apply to Windows 7/8/11.

### Fix 1 – Change adapter options

 The network adapter enables your computer to transmit and receive data on a local area network. If you’re having the 0x800704cf error, try changing the adapter settings to see if that resolves the problem.

**1)** Right-click the**network icon** in the notification area.

**2)** Click**Open Network & Internet settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-5.jpg)

 Restart your device and check if the 0x800704cf goes away. If not, continue with the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Reset TCP/IP

 TCP/IP is a suite of rules that allow computers to communicate on a network. So if there’s something wrong with the[TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%5Fprotocol%5Fsuite) settings, the 0x800704cf error may occur. To see if that’s the case, you can simply do a reset.

**1)** Type**cmd** in the search box. Then, right-click**Command Prompt** and click**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1-7.jpg)

**2)** Click**Yes** when you’re prompted to continue.

 Now that the DNS cache is cleared, NetBIOS entries are refreshed, and both the IP settings and Winsock catalog is reset, you should reboot your computer for the changes to take effect. After that, check if the issue persists; if yes, head towards the last fix.

## Bonus tips: Update your network driver

 An outdated or a faulty network driver is known to be the culprit of most network problems. To keep your network connection smooth and strong, you should check if you install the up-to-date network adapter driver. If not, update them, in either way you want.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your network adapter driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network adapter driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged network driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
