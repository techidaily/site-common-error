### Fix 2: Install the correct latest Wacom pen driver

 Your Wacom pen cannot work issue is probably due to an old, corrupted or missing**Wacom pen driver** . You can easily fix it by updating the Wacom pen driver on your Windows.

 You can update your Wacom pen drivers either manually or automatically. If you have no time, no patience or if you are a computer novice, we highly advise you to use the driver tool to help you find and download the latest driver automatically — **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With its help, you can say goodbye to driver headaches and delays forever.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the **Pro**   version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):
