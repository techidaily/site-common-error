### Fix 2: Update your keyboard driver

 If your keyboard driver is outdated or corrupted, it may also trigger this issue. In this case, you should try to update your keyboard driver.  
  
 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming and risky, so we won’t cover it here. If you’re not comfortable working on computers, it is recommended that you download **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to update your keyboard driver.  
  
 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem driver.

You can also click**Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click on**Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Snap255.png)

**3)** Right click**Policies** , select**New** and then click**Key** to create a new key. Rename the key as**System** . Please skip this step if the System key already exists.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Snap259.png)

**Value 0** means that the key**DisableTaskMgr** is**disabled** , so your Task Manager is**enabled** . If your**Value data** is**1** , it means that your**Task Manager** is currently**disabled** .  

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 If all the methods above still don’t work for you, you may need to**perform a clean boot** . The clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to manually disable startups and services so that you can find out the problematic software.

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type**msconfig** and press**Enter** to open the**System Configuration** window.

**5)** Go back to the**System Configuration** window and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Snap262.png)

**6)**  Click**Restart** to restart your PC.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Snap263.png)

 Press the**Ctrl + Alt + Del** sequence to check whether the problem reappears when your PC restarts. If not, you need to open the**System Configuration** window again to enable services and applications**one by one** until you find the problematic software. After enabling each services, you need to**restart** your PC to apply the changes.  
  
 Once you find out the problematic software, you need to**uninstall** it in order to resolve the**Ctrl + Alt + Del** not working issue.
