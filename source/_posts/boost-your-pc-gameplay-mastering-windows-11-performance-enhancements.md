### Fix 1: Check for hardware issues

 This keyboard lag problem may be caused by hardware issues. To check for potential hardware issues:

1. Depending on what kind of keyboard you’re using:  
   * **I’m using a wired keyboard** : double check that your keyboard has been connected properly. If typing still can’t catch up, try **2)** .  
   * **I’m using a wireless keyboard** : replace/charge the battery if needed. If the typing still can’t catch up, try**2)** .
