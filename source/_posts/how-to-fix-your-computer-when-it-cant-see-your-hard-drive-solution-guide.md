## Your computer won’t start

 It’s vexing when you push the power button and wait for your computer but it is unable to start. The reason could be various, but to fix this issue you can follow these fixes.

1. [Check your power supply](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Corrupted system](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Hardware issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Check your power supply

 No matter what computer you’re using, a PC or a Mac when you couldn’t launch your computer, check the power supply first. Ensure that your computer has power. Check your PC has plugged into its socket firmly. If you’re using a laptop or Macbook, plug it in and power it up.

**Note** : If it’s your laptop or Macbook, make sure you’re using the right type of charger but not a pirate one. Because a pirated charger could harm your device.

1) Turn off your computer completely.

 You might feel confused when your computer is unable to start how to turn it off? It’s because there might be some reason to prevent your computer from booting up but part of your computer may be working at that time. So you have to make sure your computer has turned off completely.

 2) Wait at least 10 seconds. Make sure your power supply has connected properly. Turn your computer back on.

 Your computer should be started properly. If it’s unable to start, move to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2: Corrupted system

 After you push the power button, if you hear the machine working noise and see the texts running on the screen but can’t boot up normally, it’s probably a system failure.

 When you encounter this situation, you’d better[boot to safe mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to troubleshoot the problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Hardware issue

 If the above fixes don’t work, it’s probably a hardware issue. If one of the components inside is old or broken inside, your computer may be unable to start. In this situation, if your computer is still under warranty, you’d better contact customer service for help. But if your PC is out of warranty and you have certain knowledge to check the hardware, you could try to open the computer case to fix it.
