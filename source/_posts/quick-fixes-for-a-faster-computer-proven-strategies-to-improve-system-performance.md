Here we list out the both **the minimum requirements** and **the recommended specifications**  (if you’re looking for a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience) specifications forHearthstone.

| |  MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS | RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS                                                  |                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPERATING SYSTEM        | Windows® XP/Windows® Vista/Windows® 7/Windows® 8 (latest Service Pack)      | Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10 64-bit (latest service pack)              |
| PROCESSOR               | Intel® Pentium® D or AMD® Athlon™ 64 X2                                     | Intel Core™ 2 Duo E6600 (2.4 GHz) or AMD Athlon 64 X2 5000+ (2.6 GHz) or better |
| GRAPHICS CARD           | NVIDIA® GeForce® 6800 (256 MB) or ATI™ Radeon™ X1600 Pro (256 MB) or better | NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (512 MB) or ATI Radeon HD 4850 (512 MB) or better        |
| MEMORY                  | 4 GB RAM                                                                    |                                                                                 |

 If you’re not sure whether your PC meets the system requirements for Hearthstone, just follow the instructions below to check the basic specs of your PC:

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c259d8946de8.png)**  and**R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** of Driver Easy.

1. Completely exit Hearthstone.
2. In Blizzard, click**Options** \>**Game Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25c6b728e28.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c271845e6c0c.jpg)
4. Click**Done** once it’s finished.
5. Relaunch Hearthstone and hopefully the**Hearthstone lagging** problem has been fixed by now. If it still lingers on, don’t worry. There’re 3 more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 4: AdjustBlizzard settings

As it turns out, having Blizzard running in background when playing a game contributes to the lag issue. So you can adjust the setting so that Blizzard exits completely once a game starts to run. Here’s how to do it:

1. In Blizzard, click**Options** \>**Game Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25c6b728e28.jpg)
2. Click**General** . Then under**WHEN I LAUNCH A GAME** , select**Exit Battle.net completely** from the drop-down menu and click**Done** .

### Fix 5: Delete the log.config file

Deleting the**log.config**file is another proven method to reduce lag according to user feedback. Here’re the steps to delete the file:

1. In Blizzard, click**Hearthstone** \>**Options** \>**Show in Explorer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25e255100a8.jpg)
2. As soon as the Hearthstone folder pops up, completely exit Blizzard (and Hearthstone).
3. Double-click on **the Hearthstone folder** and then delete the **log.config** file.
4. Restart your computer, launch Hearthstone and see if the Hearthstone lagging problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats! But if the problem still exists, you should try**Fix 6** , below.
