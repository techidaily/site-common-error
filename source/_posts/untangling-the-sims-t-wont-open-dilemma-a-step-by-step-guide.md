 Your**Windows Update** panel should come out in a couple of seconds. If it won’t open automatically, you can open this panel from Control Panel manually. Then, you should be able to download your Windows 10 from scratch.

The steps above also work if you are having a**80080080** or **8024600A**  error code. Usually the error is common with Windows 8.1 users, but for those who are using Windows 7, this solution applies as well. If the problem still persists, please be patient, Windows update takes time to download the upgrades in the background. If you still could not get this problem fixed, your Windows update tool might be corrupted so the security settings and background process is now malfunctioned. In this case, it is suggested that you burn the DVD or CD or USB flash drive with Windows 10 ISO files in to do the clean install from scratch. If you want to know how to do it, please refer to[this post here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for more information.
