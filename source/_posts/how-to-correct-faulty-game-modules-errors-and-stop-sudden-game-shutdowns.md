### Fix 1: Reinstall your battery

 In many cases, a poor connection between the battery and motherboard is the root cause of this issue. To see if that’s the problem for you, you need to reinstall your battery. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Turn off your computer.

**2)** Remove your**battery** and**AC adapter** .

**3)** Reconnect your**battery** and**AC adapter** to your computer. Then, plug the**AC adapter** back into the power outlet.

 Restart your computer and check if it can detect your battery now. If not, read on and try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Check your battery in Device Manager

 You might also have this problem because your battery is disabled in Device Manager. So you should run Device Manager to check your battery status. Here is how:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and the**R** key at the same time to open the Run dialog box.
