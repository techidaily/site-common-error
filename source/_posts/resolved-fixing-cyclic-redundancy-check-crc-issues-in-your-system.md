### Method 5: Check your antivirus software

 Sometimes your antivirus software may be the reason for the Destiny 2 stuck on initializing. So disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Method 6: Set the Windows Secondary Logon is set to automatic

 Windows Secondary Logon allows administrators to log on with a non-administrator account to perform administrative tasks without logging off. The Secondary Logon service must be enabled for Blizzard games to install and run.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** to open the Run box.
2. Type “services.msc” and press**Enter** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/services.jpg)
3. Locate and right-click**Secondary Logon** in the right pane.

4. Select**Properties** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/servi.jpg)
5. Find Startup type and select**Automatic** in the dropdown menu. Then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ser.jpg)

 Some security programs may turn the secondary logon service off. If the service is disabled again after you’ve switched it to automatic, you must configure your security program to stop disabling the service. Contact your security program’s manufacturer if you need assistance with configuring your security software.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gpu.jpg)
