## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 proven fixes for the Oculus hardware error. You may not try them all. Simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Check for connection**](#fix1)
2. [**Disable USB power saving**](#fix2)
3. [**Update your device drivers**](#fix3)
4. [**Repair corrupted system files**](#fix4)
5. **[Factory reset your Oculus Quest or Quest 2](#fix5)**

### Fix 1 – Check for connection

 The Oculus hardware error may indicate the failure to detect your VR headset or sensor. So the very first thing you should do is to check the connection. And here are a few basic steps to troubleshoot:

* If you’re connecting wirelessly, don’t forget to**enable Air Link** on both the Oculus desktop settings and headset settings. But if you’re using the Link cable, make sure to toggle off the Air Link option.
* **Power off your headset, turn it on, and then replug it back in** . Sometimes a simple restart will just solve the temporary glitches.
* Try c**onnecting the headset to another USB port** on your computer. You may switch between USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports to see which works.
* **Disconnect other unnecessary peripherals** such as digital camera, printer or external hard drive from the computer to avoid interference.

If the headset is still not recognized, check out the next solution.

### Fix 2 – Disable USB power saving

 Windows may enable the power-saving feature for your USB ports by default. That said, an individual USB port may shut down when it’s used intermittently and cause the headset not connecting. To prevent your devices from disconnecting randomly or not being recognized, you could adjust related settings as follows:

**Change the power management settings**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

### Fix 3 – Update your device drivers

 Device drivers allow your hardware to communicate with the computer. If they’re faulty or outdated, your Oculus performance will be greatly impacted. So staying up-to-date with the latest drivers, your graphics driver and USB driver in particular, is essential for a smooth experience with the Oculus devices.

 You could get the most recent drivers directly from the manufacturer’s website, download and install them manually. But if you’re not familiar with device drivers or don’t have the time and patience to update them manually, use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do it automatically and easily.

3. Click the**Update** button next to any flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).
