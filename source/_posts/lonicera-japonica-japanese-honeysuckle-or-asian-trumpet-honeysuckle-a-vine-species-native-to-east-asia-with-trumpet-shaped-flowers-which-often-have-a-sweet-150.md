But the good news is, this is not a difficult issue to resolve.

### Fix 3: Use the Ethernet connection

It’s recommended to use the Ethernet connection, since playing games like Destiny 2 requires a more stable and faster Internet connection.

Right click on the**network icon** at the bottom right corner on your desktop, and click**Open Network and Sharing Center** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f04abb90727.png) If you don’t see “**Open Network and Sharing Center** ” there, you can click**Open Network and Internet settings** , then click**Network and Sharing Center** in**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ade913312.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae1eb2cb9.jpg)
