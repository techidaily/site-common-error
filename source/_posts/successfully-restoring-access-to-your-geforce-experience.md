## Fix 3: Reinstall your application

 Sometimes the application you want to run may contain something that has corrupted. In this case, you should uninstall your application completely and then reinstall it. After that run the program and see if your problem resolves.

## Fix 4: Reinstall Microsoft .NET framework

 In fact, in many cases the “The application was unable to start correctly” error results from issues with**Microsoft .NET framework** . (.NET framework is a framework developed by Microsoft which supports applications using .Net technologies.) You may need to reinstall it to fix the issue.

 \* Microsoft .NET framework has been an integral part of**Windows 8 and 10** . You**cannot** remove or reinstall it manually. Therefore the steps below may only apply to**Windows 7 or earlier versions** . For**Windows 10/8** users, you can try[**updating your Windows**](#f) to install the latest .NET framework (if any).

**a)**  Press**Win + R** keys. Type “_**control**_ ” and hit**OK** .

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…
