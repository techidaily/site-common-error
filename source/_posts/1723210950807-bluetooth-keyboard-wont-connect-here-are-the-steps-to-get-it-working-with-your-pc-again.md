 Here are 7 fixes that have helped other users fix their Bluetooth keyboard connection issues. You might not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

5. **[Restart Bluetooth Support Service](#Fix5)**

## Fix 1: Check your Bluetooth keyboard

 **Your Bluetooth keyboard can stop working if the batteries are worn out or not installed properly.** To test the batteries, you can simply replace them with brand new ones or recharge the batteries by connecting the charging cable to a power source.

 **Make sure your Bluetooth keyboard is discoverable and in range of the PC you need to connect to.** Remove other USB devices as these might interfere with Bluetooth connections.

## Fix 2: Check your PC

### in Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. In Windows Settings, click**Network & Internet** .

 If airplane mode is already set to Off, try turning off Bluetooth, waiting a few seconds, and then turning it back on.

### in Windows 11

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. From the left navigation panel, select**Bluetooth & devices** , then toggle**On** Bluetooth from the right.
