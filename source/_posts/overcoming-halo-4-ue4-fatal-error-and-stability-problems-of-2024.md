## 1\. Reinstall ftdibus.sys driver

 ftdibus.sys is a system file for FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) USB devices, which are usually preinstalled on your computer chipset. So you may not recall using FTDI USB devices yourself, which makes it quite hard to update or reinstall the driver. But things don’t have to be like this: follow the instructions below to see how you can reinstall the ftdibus.sys driver:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time. Type**cmd** and hit**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to open Command Prompt as administrator. When prompted for permission, click**Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-49.png)
2. Type this command:**`pnputil.exe -d oem<NUMBER>.inf`** and hit**Enter** .  

 The <NUMBER> here should be filled with the number you see on your computer. For instance, I’m seeing**51** , so my command should be**`pnputil.exe -d oem51.inf`** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-50.png)
3. This is how the command looks like on my computer. Hit**Enter** when the command is typed in.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-51.png)
4. When you see**Driver package deleted successfully** , restart your computer for the ftdibus.sys driver to be install automatically by Windows again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-52.png)

 Go go the Core Isolation window again to see if the fdtibus.sys driver is still regarded as an incompatible driver that stops Memory Integrity from turning on. If so, please move on.
