### Fix 1: Reconnect your device

 When your mouse stops responding, the first option always reconnect the device. Normally you can reconnect by turn off and turn on the mouse, unplugging and plugging the dongle for the receiver or reboot your computer to reconnect the Bluetooth mouse with your computer.  
 But if these couldn’t help, you can re-add the Bluetooth mouse from Control Panel to re-enumerate the Bluetooth receiver, then the mouse could be detected.

 The following steps will guide you on how to reconnect your device by using a keyboard.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** together to evoke the Run box.
2. Type**control panel** and press the**Enter** key.
