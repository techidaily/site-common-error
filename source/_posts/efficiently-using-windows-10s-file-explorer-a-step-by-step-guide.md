### What to do if you can’t turn Bluetooth on in Windows 10/11

 Here are the top three ways to fix Bluetooth issues in Windows 10\. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Update the Bluetooth driver on your computer](#solution1)
2. [Re-enable the Bluetooth driver software in Device Manager](#solution2)
3. [Make sure the Bluetooth Support Service is running](#solution3)

 If it’s your **first time** connecting Bluetooth devices with your Windows 10 computer, you might need to **check if your computer has Bluetooth** .  
 If you’re sure your computer supports Bluetooth, move on to the solutions.

 **Here’s how you can check if your computer supports Bluetooth:**

1. On your desktop, right-click on the Start button to select   **Device Manager.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be92c4740356.jpg)
2. In Device Manager, check to see if there’s a**Bluetooth section** or if there’s any**Bluetooth adapter** located in the**Network adapters** section. The Bluetooth adapter could also be listed under the**Other devices** section due to some errors.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be92f6f87b46.jpg)

 a) If you**do** find one or more Bluetooth adapters in Device Manager, your computer supports Bluetooth. Move on to the solutions to continue to  solve your problem.

 b) If you can’t find any Bluetooth adapter in Device Manager, your PC doesn’t support Bluetooth. But don’t worry, a **[Bluetooth receiver](https://www.amazon.com/Avantree-Bluetooth-Computer-Keyboard-Warranty/dp/B00VWEK4IG/ref=sr%5F1%5F15?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1542008853&sr=1-15&tag=easeware-aprilcai-20)**  can easily solve the problem for you.

#### Fix 1: Update the Bluetooth driver on your computer

 Bluetooth needs the supporting hardware and software to work. When you’re sure your computer supports Bluetooth, but it’s still not working, the first thing you should do is update your Bluetooth driver.

 There are two ways you can update your Bluetooth driver: manually and automatically.

To **manuall**  y update the driver, head to your computer manufacturer’s website and search for the most recent correct Bluetooth driver. Make sure you choose the right driver for your version of Windows (32-bit or 64-bit).

 But if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your Bluetooth driver manually, you can do it **automatically**  with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically find the correct Bluetooth driver for your computer, download it, and install it correctly. Here’s how:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , install, and run Driver Easy.
2. Click **Scan Now** .  It will detect all of your computer’s driver issues (including your Bluetooth driver) in less than a minute.

## What to do if the above suggestions don’t work: Switch to ChromeOS

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…
