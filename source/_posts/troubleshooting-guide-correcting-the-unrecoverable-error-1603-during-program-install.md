## Troubleshooting PUBG Building Loading Errors - Effective Fixes Inside

Many**PUBG**players are recently reporting an issue with their game. Their PUBG is**not loading the** **texture of buildings and other objects**after they land on the ground, which makes the game graphics look retro. If you’re also experiencing this issue, don’t worry. You should be able to fix your issue with one of the solutions below.

## Try these fixes

You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Press Tab when parachuting**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Move your game files to your SSD (if you have one)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/pubg-buildings-not-loading-fixed/#b)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Reinstall your game**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Press Tab when parachuting

To fix your game graphics issue, you can make your game load the building texture before landing. To do so, when your parachute is pulled out, press the**Tab**key on your keyboard to bring up the inventory screen. Your game may freeze for a while, as it’s loading the texture. After that, check to see if this fixes your texture issues. Hopefully it does. But if not, there are still three fixes for you to try…

### Method 2: Move your game files to your SSD (if you have one)

If you’re using an solid-state drive (SSD), you should try moving your games file there to speed up the loading process. To move your game files to your SSD:**1)** On your Steam client, click**Steam**, then click**Settings**.

### Method 3: Update your graphics driver

Your game may not be able to load the building texture properly if you’re not using a correct graphics driver or it’s out of date. You should update this driver to see if this fixes your issue. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . **Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ): **1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** . **2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_your graphics adapter_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

### Method 4: Reinstall your game

Your PUBG files may have been corrupted so you are having the texture loading issues. You can reinstall your game to repair the corrupted files. After that, run your game and, if this method helps you, you should see the texture of buildings is fully loaded. We hope one of these fixes works for you!
