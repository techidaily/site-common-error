### Fix 4: Tweak your audio settings

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

1. Right-click on  **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click  **Sounds**  .

 If **no microphone devices shows up in the device list** , then right-click on **the empty space** and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on **the microphone device**  once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .
3. Click on **your microphone device**   and click **Properties** .

### Fix 5: Reinstall Skype

 If all else fails, then chances are you didn’t give Skype proper permissions or there are some misconfigurations that account for the mic not working issue. So you should reinstall the app and see if it fixes the problem.

 It’s highly recommended you download the latest version off **[the official website](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/)**  for security concerns.

 After that, don’t forget to launch Skype and check if it’s working as you expect it to.
