 Here are 5 fixes that have helped other users resolve the mouse frozen on laptop problem. You may not have to try all of them; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

 To properly navigate your system, you might want to switch to the touchpad mouse if you’re using an external mouse and vice versa.

1. **[Check for physical issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Try the function keys](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

5. [**Repair system files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Check for physical issues

Depending on which mouse isn’t working:

* If it’s the touchpad mouse, then move on to**Fix 2** .
* If it’s the external mouse, then try a different port, a different functioning mouse, and replace/recharge the battery (if it has one) to see if this fixes the problem. If not, move on to**Fix 2** .

### Fix 2: Try the function keys

 Sometimes the mouse-isn’t-moving issue happens just because you’ve pressed the function keys and disabled trackpad unknowingly. If that’s the case, we might have to press the keys again to turn it back on. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, hold down**the Fn key** and press**the touchpad key** (or**F7** ,**F8** ,**F9** ,**F5** , depending on the laptop brand you’re using).
2. Move your mouse and check if the **mouse frozen on laptop** issue has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if the problem persists, move on to**Fix 3** , below.
