### Fix 1: Be sure to meet system requirements

 If your computer doesn’t meet the minimum requirements to play the game, you’ll run into problems like the DirectX encountered an unrecoverable error.

 So you should check the system requirement for your game. As there are different games, we’ll take Call of Duty as an example:

**Minimum system requirements for Call of Duty** :

 If your system meets the requirements and you still get the error, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Install the latest patch

 Game developers always keep releasing patches to improve their games and fix any issues, so you should check for updates of your game in Steam or from the official website. Then install the latest patch to keep it up to date. This can fix your DirectX error.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 A missing or outdated graphics card driver can cause your**DirectX encountered an unrecoverable error** . To rule it out as the cause for your problem, you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update the driver** – You should go to the manufacturer’s website of your graphics card, search for the latest version, then download and install it on your computer. Be sure to download the latest correct driver that is compatible with your operating system.

**Automatically update the driver** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll get full support and a**30-day money money guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c188ed304dbc.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics card to automatically download the correct version for their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version), then install it in your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c188ef639182.jpg)  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when your click**Update All** ).

4. Restart your computer to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

Now launch your game again to see if it fixes your problem.

 Still no changes? Don’t give up hope. There is something else you can do.

### Fix 4: Upgrade DirectX version

 As this is an error about DirectX, it’s necessary to check whether the DirectX version meets the DirectX requirement for your game.

#### Step 1: Check your game’s required DirectX version

 First of all, you should know for sure the DirectX version required to run the game. You can search for the information from the official website. For example, Call of Duty requires DirectX 11 on your computer.

#### Step 2: Check the DirectX version on your computer

 Next, you should check what the DirectX version is on your computer, and see if it meets the requirement.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6d1c42af90.jpg)
3. In the**System** tab of the**DirectX** **Dianostic** **Tool** , you can see the**DirectX** information in your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c18c7dc5dff8.jpg)

 Then see if the DirectX meets the DirectX requirement for the game. If not, you’ll need to upgrade the DirectX version on your computer.

#### Step 3: Upgrade DirectX on your computer

 Generally speaking, for Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, you can directly update your Windows via Windows Update to the latest version to install the latest DirectX on your computer. However, for Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP, you may need to install an update package to install the latest DirectX on your computer.

 You can go to the **[Microsoft website](https://support.microsoft.com/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx)**  for more information about how to install the latest version of DirectX for different versions of Windows.

 After installing the latest Windows update or update package, restart your computer and try the game again to see if the error disappears.
