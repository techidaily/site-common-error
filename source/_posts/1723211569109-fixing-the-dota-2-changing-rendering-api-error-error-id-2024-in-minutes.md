## How to fix Dota 2 Change Rendering API error

 Before running the game, you can use the Game Launch Options feature on Steam to change game settings. Launch options allow the user to supersede the internal settings of the game. This is an effective means to recover from incompatible video settings and well as troubleshoot a wide range of issues. So in order to get rid of the error message, you should set a launch option specifically for Dota 2\. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Under the **Library** in Steam, right-click on your game title**Dota 2,** and select **Properties** .

 2) Under the **General** tab, click the **SET LAUNCH OPTIONS…** button.

 4) Close your game’s **Properties** window and your problem should be solved. Till then launch your game.
