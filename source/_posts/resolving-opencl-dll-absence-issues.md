 After your game is installed, relaunch it to test your issue. If the issue continues to occur, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 If you keep getting the d3dx9\_39.dll missing error, it’s unlikely that an outdated graphics driver is the core issue, but you should rule out the possibility. There are two ways you can get the correct driver for your hardware:

* [**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**](#d1)
* [**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**](#d2)

**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your hardware keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
