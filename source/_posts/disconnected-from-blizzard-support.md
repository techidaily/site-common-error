![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5adef456b0f67.png)

 Many gamers are having an annoying issue with their game. When their game is running, they see an error that says “Your video card does not support alpha blending with floating point render targets, which is required to run this game” and it crashes their game. This issue happens constantly.

 This is incredibly frustrating. You can’t play your game because of this error. But don’t worry. This error can be fixed. The following is a method that have helped many gamers fix this error.

## Try this fix

 You will get the error if you’re using a wrong or outdated driver. So you should update the device drivers on your computer and see if this fixes your error.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .

**2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to each device to download the latest and correct driver for it.

You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer.
