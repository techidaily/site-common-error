### Method 5: Update your audio driver

 One reason for many computer errors is outdated drivers for your hardware devices. You should verify that your devices have the right and latest drivers, and update those that don’t.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**Download and install the driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snap67-2.jpg)
3. Click the**Update button** next to the selected driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

### Method 6: Roll back your audio driver

 When you meet the error, you check your drivers and find they’ve already updated to the latest version. In this case, you must make sure they are compatible with your system. It’s because sometimes the latest version of device driver doesn’t work properly on your system and start interfering with the computer’s normal start-up process.  
 So, roll back your driver to the previous version to solve the issue.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** together to invoke the Run box.
2. Type “devmgmt.msc” and click**OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05-1.jpg)
3. In the Device Manager, click**Sound, video and game controllers** , then right-click on your audio adapter device and click**Properties** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/10.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Under the**Driver** tab, click **Roll Back Driver** , then follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

2. Type “mmsys.cpl” and click**OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/03-2.jpg)
3. Under the**Playback** tab, select the audio device that meets the issue (if you have more than one audio device) and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/04-1.jpg)
4. Click the**Advanced** tab, select the sample rate that you wish to use. Then click**OK** . Back to the Sound window, click**Apply** \>**OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/12.jpg)
