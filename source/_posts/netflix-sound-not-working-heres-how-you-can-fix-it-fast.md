 The error may be caused by a loose connection, so you can try checking the connection.  
 If you are using a USB keyboard, try unplugging it then plugging it back in.
 If you are using a wireless keyboard, try troubleshooting the wireless connection.

---

### **Method 3: Plug the keyboard to another USB port** (for USB keyboard only)

 The USB port that you are using may be having problem. Try plugging the keyboard to another USB port and see if the error persists.
