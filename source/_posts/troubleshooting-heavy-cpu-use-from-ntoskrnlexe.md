## Optimizing ntoskrnl.exe for Better Performance on PC

 If your Windows is working slowly, and when you check your Task Manager and find that the**System** item is hogging much of your CPU (or Disk in some cases) usage, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting this problem. Don’t worry, it’s possible to fix.

**\*** Right-click the**System** item and click**Properties** , you’ll see a new item called**ntoskrnl.exe** .

## What is ntoskrnl.exe?

 Ntoskrnl.exe, short for**Windows NT operating system kernel** , is a fundamental part of the system. Usually, when you see the uncommon usage of high CPU or memory, you should shut down the possible programs that are causing the problem.

 If this happens a lot, you should see if there is something wrong with certain application settings or files in your system.

## How do I fix it?

 Here are 4 methods for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

* **[Method 1: Disable Windows Search Service](#a)**
* **[Method 2: Check Incompatible Programs](#b)**
* **[Method 3: Run SFC and DISM](#c)**
* **[Method 4: Disable Runtime Broker](#d)** [](#d)

 It is always suggested that you keep your device drivers updated to eliminate the possibility of such problems.

## Method 1: Disable Windows Search service

 A lot of users suggested that disabling Windows Search helps to reduce the CPU and Disk usage caused by ntoskrnl.exe. To see if this does the trick for you as well:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then click **Computer management** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/computer-management.png)
2. Expand**Services and Applications** and click**Services** .

## Method 2: Check incompatible programs

 Some users say that this only happens when they use certain programs. Especially when they have antivirus software running in the background. The antivirus software might have some conflicts with certain programs. The next time you encounter this situation, try to pay extra attention to see if you can find the program that is messing with your system. If such a program can be located, try reinstallingit or uninstalling it completely.

## Method 3: Run SFC and DISM

 Corrupted system files may cause high CPU and disk usage with ntoskrnl.exe, but luckily, there are two built-in tools that can help to identify and repair such bad system files. The whole process could take some time, and we suggest you don’t run any other programs when doing the test. To run these tools:

### 3.1\. Scan corrupt files with System File Checker

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** at the same time to run Command Prompt as administrator.

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Checker will then scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now.jpg)

### 3.2\. Run dism.exe

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following commands and hit**Enter** after each line:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

2) When the process finishes:

* If the DISM tool gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** , reboot your computer, then open Command Prompt as administrator again (step 1) and run this command line instead:

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 When these tests are done, see if the ntoskrnl.exe high CPU or disk usage problem remains. If the problem still persists, please move on to the next fix.

## Method 4: Disable Runtime Broker

 Normally, the runtime broker process should only use a very low CPU resource, but if things go wrong, it could take up to 100% CPU and disk usage, making your Windows run slowly and buggy. In this case, you can try to disable it to see if it helps. To do so:

 Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here: [How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R** key together. Type **regedit** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-27.png)
3. Go to the following location: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TimeBroker`

5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

See if the ntoskrnl.exe high CPU or disk usage problem remains.
