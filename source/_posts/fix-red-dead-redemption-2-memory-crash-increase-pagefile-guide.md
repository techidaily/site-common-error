### What is WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.exe)?

**WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.exe)** stands for Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service. It’s an important service that applications cannot run without. If this process stops, many of the features in your PC will become useless. On top of all that, you might not even receive error notifications.

### How do I fix it?

 Here are 4 solutions you can try to fix this issue. You may not need to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

**[1: Run Virus Scan](#f1)**
**[2: Boot into Safe Mode with Networking](#f2)**
**[3: Restart WMI Provider Host Service](#f3)**
**[4: Uninstall Components and Drivers Causing the Problem](#f4)**

## Fix 1: Run Virus Scan

 In some cases, the culprit is virus or malware. You just need to run your antivirus program to get it fixed. If you haven’t done it yet, you should do it right now.

 If your PC detect any unwanted programs or applications, remove them completely from your computer, and restart afterwards.

 It’s important that you download and install programs and drivers only from trustworthy sources.

There are two ways you can update and install your drivers:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your device, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.
