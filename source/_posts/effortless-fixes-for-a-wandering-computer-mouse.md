### Solution 3: Update your network adapter driver

 This problem could be also due to**a corrupted, old or missing network driver** on your system. So you can solve it through updating your network driver.

 Updating drivers require Internet connection on your computer. If your computer can’t access the wireless network, try to connect your computer to a wired network connection or, you can try the[Offline Scan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) feature of Driver Easy.

You can update your network driver either manually or automatically.

#### Manual driver update

 You can update your network driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your network adapter, say,**Realtek** , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

#### Automatic driver update

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the Pro version which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
