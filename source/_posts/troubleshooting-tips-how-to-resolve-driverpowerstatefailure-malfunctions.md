### Fix 2: Set default devices

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your device and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices (both output device and input device) manually to see if it fixes your**Overwatch voice chat not working** issue.  

Here’s how to do it:

1. Exit Overwatch.
2. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **mmsys.cpl** and press**Enter** .

3. In the **Playback**  tab, right-click on**the speakers/headphones you’re to use in Overwatch** and  click **Set Default** .

 If your voice chat is set to**Push To Talk** , try changing the keybind for Voice Chat:**Push To Talk** to a different key in the Controls menu.
