## **Check the permission of the file or folder you want to open**

You can follow these steps to check the permission.

 3\. Under**Group or user names** , select your name. Then under**Permissions for Camilla** , in**Allow** column, check the checkbox next to the Permission you wish to have (For example, if you want to Modify the file or folder, check the checkbox next to it). If you are not sure which Permission you should select, check all boxes.

 Note if all boxes are grayed out with a tick in them, it means the permissions are enabled. In this case, this method doesn’t work for you, move on to the next method.
