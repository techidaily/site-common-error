## Why does the error occur to my computer?

 In various situations you’ll see the error “**Failed to initialize network** “. So you’ll need to troubleshoot first to identify the cause of your problem.

 Usually the cause of the Dragon Ball FighterZ network issue can be either the Dragon Ball FighterZ problem or your computer problem. If the Dragon Ball FighterZ servers are down or under maintenance, you’ll definitely see the error and can’t continue playing the game.

 In the mean time, your computer network stops working, and your game will fail to start and pop up with the error “Failed to initialize network”. In addition, your network card issue can also result in the network issue in Dragon Ball FighterZ.

## Try these fixes

 Here are solutions that have helped people resolve the error. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until your Dragon Ball FighterZ gets running again!

1. [Identify the cause of the problem](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Reset network settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Update the network card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Identify the cause of the problem

 To see what’s going on and find the solution, you should identify the reason of the error.

 If the servers for Dragon Ball FighterZ are down, or under maintenance, you, and everyone else who’s playing the game, will receive this error and can’t play the game currently. So you can contact the Dragon Ball FighterZ support and see if that’s the case. if so, there’s nothing you can do but just wait for the servers on line. Since the developers won’t inform you when the problem has been resolved, you should check periodically and see if it works.

 If other people can log in and play the game without problems, it seems the cause lies in your computer. You can choose another region and see if you can play the same. If that’s unavailable, or that didn’t fix your problem, it means that you need to do something in your PC. Then go to[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
