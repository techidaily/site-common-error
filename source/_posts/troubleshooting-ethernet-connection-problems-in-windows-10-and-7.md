### Method 3: Update your video driver to the latest version

 If the both methods above fails to help you, you can try to update your video driver to the latest version.

 There’re two ways you can get the right driver for your video card:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your video driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your video card, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 7.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact video card, and your variant of Windows 7, and it will download and install it correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
