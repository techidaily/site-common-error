 If unluckily, neither method 1 nor method 2 helps you fix the error, it’s advise that update your WiFi driver with Method 3.

## Method 3\. Update your WiFi driver

 It is very important to update your WiFi drivers, because the wrong or outdated drivers may cause problems.

 There are two ways you can update your driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically (Recommend)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-the-hosted-network-couldnt-be-started-on-windows-10/#op2) .

#### Option 1 – Manually

 1) Follow[step 1 in Method 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to open Device Manager.

 2) Find and expand the**Network adapters** . Right-click on your wireless network adapter in Device Manager.  
 Then choose**Update driver** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_595db84f55cbc.jpg)

 3) Click**Search automatically for updated driver software** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_595db867abdfc.png)

Now Microsoft will detect the update for you automatically.

 However, for some reason, Microsoft cannot always find the update for you. If you receive the message:**The best driver software for your device is already installed** , please try the next method to update the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
