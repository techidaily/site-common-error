1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Esc**   at the same time to open **Task Manager** .
2. Right-click on the programs you donâ€™t need to run at the moment and click **End task** .

1. Create a shortcut of your PUBG, then right-click on the**shortcut** and click**Properties** .
2. Under the **Shortcut** tab, in **Target** field, leave**a space** and type**resolution:** **the resolution of your preference** (1024Ã—768 for example).
3. Start a game in PUBG and check if the lag in PUBG issues have been resolved. If yes, then congrats! But if the issues still persist, you should move on to**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 5: Change the power option and adjust for best performance

 By default, the power plan on our computer is often configured to **Balanced**   or **Power saver**   to conserve battery, which largely compromises the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Also the system performance on our computer may also be undermined for the advanced graphics features.

So to tweak the settings:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4e6c91572.png)
2. Choose the **High performance** option.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4f0b203f9.jpg)
3. In the top-right corner of the window, type **advanced**  and click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c503626f65.jpg)
4. Click **Adjust for best performance** \> **Apply** \> **OK** .
