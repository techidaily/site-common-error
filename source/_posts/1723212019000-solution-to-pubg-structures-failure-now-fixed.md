### Fix 1: Modify BIOS settings

 The first thing you should do is to modify your BIOS settings. If you’re not so familiar with BIOS (Basic Input and Output System), you may refer to[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for further details or simply do some online searching.

 Some third-party applications may have claimed a usage of your function keys, hence the reason for your Fn keys not working. To reverse these unwanted changes, you can enter BIOS and tweak the relevant system settings.

 The interface of BIOS Setup Utility looks quite different from one to another due to different versions. If the following procedures don’t make sense to you, you may either find your own way to reach the Fn keys or hot keys section in BIOS, or seek help from other tutorials.

 The following steps have covered two different versions of BIOS. Just check them out one by one and see which suits you better.

#### Version 1

 1)**Restart** your PC.

 2) Focus on your screen during the boot process. When the**Lenovo logo** shows up,**press and hold** the button on your keyboard that allows you to enter BIOS. Usually the access key varies among different brands of computers: for HP laptops, it may be**ESC** ; for others however, it becomes**F1** ,**F2** ,**F3** ,**Delete** , or**Enter** ….

 In case you’re using a notebook, you’ll be likely to see an instruction at the bottom of the Lenovo startup screen (one that displays the Lenovo logo) that tells you which key to press in order to enter BIOS. If otherwise, please consult your PC manufacturer or go through your user manual to figure out the exact button.

 3) Do not release the BIOS access key until you finally enter the BIOS configuration.

 These two videos from ASUS Customer Service provide more depth on how to enter BIOS:  
 For**notebook** users, click **[here](https://www.asus.com/us/support/FAQ/1008829/)**  .  
 For**desktop computer** users (Windows 10), click **[here](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1013015/)**  .

 4) Once you enter BIOS Setup Utility, press the right arrow key on your keyboard to select the**Config** tab.

 5) Use the down arrow key to highlight**Keyboard/Mouse** . Then, hit**Enter** .

 6) In the next window, locate this item:**F1-F12 as Primary Function** . Use the down arrow key to highlight it, and then change its setting to**Enabled** .

 7) Once you complete the tweak, press**F10** to save the changes and exit BIOS. When prompted for confirmation, select**Yes** .

#### Version 2

In another version of BIOS, the procedure may go like this:

 1) Repeat**Step 1** **through** **Step 3** in**[Version 1](#v1)** . Then, press the right arrow key on your keyboard to select the**Configuration** tab.

 2) In the following section, use the down arrow key to highlight**HotKey Mode** and switch its status to**Disabled** .

 3) Press the**Exit** button on your keyboard to save the changes and exit BIOS. When prompted for confirmation, select**Yes** .

 Will till your PC gets fully restarted. After that, check to see if your problem has been solved. If not, you may proceed to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Roll back Lenovo PM Driver

 As many Windows 7 users reported, their Fn keys stop working right after a Windows update. If that’s the case for you, you should try to roll back your Lenovo PM (Power Management) driver. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then, type in**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-06-17_14-24-52.png)

 2) In Device Manager, double-click on the**System devices** node to expand its drop-down list. Next, locate**Lenovo PM Device** and right-click on it. From the context menu, select**Properties** .

 If the option appears dimmed, that means there’s no previous driver for you to roll back to. In this case, you should try out the next method instead.

 4) Follow the onscreen instructions to roll back your driver. Don’t forget to reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Now it’s time to check whether your function keys have gone back to normal. If not, proceed to the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Update your chipset/keyboard drivers

 Sometimes an outdated or corrupt driver may cause you trouble, like preventing the Fn keys from working properly. To cure the issue, you should consider updating both your chipset and keyboard drivers that are closely related to the normal functioning of Fn keys.

There’re two ways you can update the drivers:

**[Option 1 – Update drivers via Device Manager](https://electronicx.pxf.io/xkwqkk)**  – It’s the most common method but sometimes Windows may not detect or provide you with the latest drivers.

OR

**[Option 2 – Update drivers automatically with Driver Easy](#option2) (Recommended)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

---

#### **Option 1 – Update drivers via Device Manager**

 If you feel like updating your chipset and keyboard drivers via Device Manager, here are the steps:

 1) Press the**Windows Logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then, type in**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-126.png)

 4) Follow the onscreen instructions to download and install your keyboard drivers.

**Note that** Windows may not be able to download and install the latest drivers for you. If you receive a notification (as shown below) that reads “The best drivers for your device are already installed,” it doesn’t necessarily mean your keyboard driver is up-to-date. Perhaps you should look to the manufacturer’s website for any lately released versions, if possible.

 5) After updating your keyboard drivers, you should now make similar changes to the chipset drivers. In Device Manager, double-click**System devices** to expand its drop-down list.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-128.png)

 6) Scroll through the list to locate the items related to your motherboard chipsets, as illustrated below. (Your devices may not be exactly the same as those shown in the following screenshot. In this case, simply update the items of similar titles.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-129.png)

 7) Right-click on each of these devices and select**Update driver** .

 8) Repeat**Step3 through Step 4** to update your chipset driver.
