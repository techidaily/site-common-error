## Fix 3: Scan and repair your drivers

 The constant crashes could indicate a compatibility issue with device drivers. In other words, you might be using**faulty or outdated computer drivers** . Usually this is what makes your system unstable, and it often happens after a system upgrade. You should run a scan and check if you have all the**latest correct drivers** .

 You can check your drivers manually, by visiting the manufacturer websites one by one, finding the latest correct driver installer and installing step by step. But if you don’t like playing with device drivers, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a smart driver updater that repairs & updates your drivers automatically.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and check if Windows 11 crashes again.

If the issue persists, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 In some cases, the constant crashes can be triggered by incompatible software, especially those relating to hardware control, like Logitech Options and MSI Afterburner. To rule out the possibilities, you can do a clean boot and start Windows with only the essential components.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering, and click **Disable** .

## Fix 5: Check for corrupted system files

 The constant crashes could imply that some critical files are corrupted or missing. This also happened when some users upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

 There’re 2 ways you can scan and repair your system:[manually](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba) or[automatically (Recommended)](#option2) .

### Option 1: Scan & repair manually

 It may take some time and skills to check and repair the system files manually. You’ll need to run several commands, and if you’re not a tech-savvy user, don’t forget to back up all important files first.

#### Step 1: Scan corrupt files with System File Checker

1. On your keyboard, press Win+R (the Windows logo key and the R key) to open the Run box. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/windows-11-cmd-run.jpg)
2. In Command Prompt, type**sfc /scannow** and hit **Enter** . Allow System File Check to scan your system. It could take up to 5 minutes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sfc-1.jpg)
3. You may see something like the followings after the verification:  

   1. no errors  
   2. it fixed some errors  
   3. could not fix all errors  
   4. could not fix errors at all

 No matter what message you saw, next you can try to fix the issue with the DISM tool.

#### Step 2: Repair with the DISM tool

 1) Run Command Prompt as administrator and enter the following commands.

* This command scans your system:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This line should repair your system:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 If the restore process raises errors, you can always try the following command. Note this could take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you see**Error: 0x800F081F** during the process, reboot and run the following:

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 If the System File Check finds any files corrupted, follow the on-screen instructions to repair them, and then restart your PC for the changes to take full effect.

Once completed, restart your computer and check if Windows crashes again.

## Fix 6: Disable overclocking

 Overclocking allows you to get the most of your hardware, but first you need to have a stable system. It’s common knowledge that tuning the frequency of your CPU/GPU/RAM could undermine system stability. If you’re overclocking with software like**MSI Afterburner, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel XTU)** or**AMD Ryzen Master** , turn them off and see how things go. Also, check if you forgot some settings in the BIOS.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/msi-afterburner-featured.jpg)

If you’re not overclocking, simply continue to the next solution.

## Fix 7: Increase the virtual memory

 If you experience crashes after opening multiple programs, or one single memory-guzzler like Photoshop, Chrome (Yes the browser) and Premiere, chances are your computer is out of RAM. In that case, you could RAM by getting more memory sticks. But if you’re in a hurry, you can work around this issue by**increasing the virtual memory** .

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **advanced system settings** . Click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/windows-11-advanced-system-settings.jpg)
2. Under the **Performance**  section, click **Settings…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/system-advanced-performance-virtual-memory.jpg)
3. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Advanced**  tab. Under the **Virtual memory** section, click **Change…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-advanced.jpg)
4. Deselect the **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox. Then select **Customize size** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/virtual-memory-03.jpg)
5. Enter **Initial size** and **Maximum size** according to the physical memory of your computer. Microsoft recommends that virtual memory should be 1.5 to 3 times the size of physical memory. In my case, the physical memory (actual RAM) of my computer is 8 GB, so the **Initial size** for me here is **8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB** , and the **Maximum size** should be **8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB** . Once you’ve entered your size of virtual memory, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-set-02.jpg)
6. Restart your PC.

 Now you can test the result by repeating the same behavior before the last crash.

If this trick doesn’t give you luck, simply try the next one.

## Fix 8: Check the crash log

 Actually the most effective way to find out how to fix the issue lies in the**crash log** . In case you don’t know what the crash log is, it’s a part of the built-in**Event Viewer** which records the status and behavior of your system & apps. Most of the time when your system crashes, there’ll be error messages in the crash log to help you troubleshoot.

Here’s how to check the crash log:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** to open the Run dialog. Type **eventvwr** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eventvwr.png)
2. In the left pane, double click**Windows Logs** and select**System** . Then**select the event according to the crash time** and you’ll find the details at the bottom.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/crash-log.jpg)

 You can then search the error message on Google and troubleshoot the issue more effectively.
