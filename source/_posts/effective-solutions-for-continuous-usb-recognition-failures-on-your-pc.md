### Method 3: Check your antivirus software

 The “Hamachi service stopped” error may be caused by your antivirus software. When Hamachi was blocked by your antivirus software, the error will appear.  
 To solve it, you can change your antivirus software settings to make sure Hamachi won’t be blocked. If you don’t know how to do it, you can consult your antivirus software official customer service.

 There’s another situation that Hamachi isn’t blocked by antivirus software. Hamachi may have a conflict with your antivirus software. Therefore, uninstall the antivirus software and restart your computer can help you solve the error.

 If this resolves the problem, you can install another antivirus software. But if you are fond of the old one, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice.

**IMPORTANT:** Be extra careful in using the Internet after uninstalled your antivirus.
