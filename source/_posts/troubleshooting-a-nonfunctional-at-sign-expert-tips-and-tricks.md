2. [**Disconnect and reconnect your power cord (for laptop)**](#s2)
3. [**Check your power management settings**](#s3)
4. [**Update your USB driver**](#s4)

### Step 1: Use a different USB port

If all your USB ports aren’t working, try Step 2, below.

### Step 2: Disconnect and reconnect your power cord (for laptop)

 If your Dell laptop has any problem with the power supply, the USB ports on your laptop may stop working. To check for power supply issues, you can follow these steps:

1. **Disconnect** the AC adapter or power cord from your laptop.

2. **Restart** your computer.
3. **Plug** your USB device into your laptop.
4. **Reconnect** the AC adapter or power cord.
5. **Check** if your USB device works now. If not, try Step 3, below.

### Step 3: Check your power management settings

 It’s also possible that Windows switches off your USB controllers when they’re not in use to save power, and “forgets” to switch them on when they’re needed. You can take these steps to have a check:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key and R at the same time to invoke the Run box.**
2. **Type devmgmt.msc and press Enter.**

### Step 4: Update your USB driver

 If the steps above didn’t work for you, the most likely cause is a USB driver problem.

Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your USB driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your USB driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your USB device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

or

**Update your USB driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
