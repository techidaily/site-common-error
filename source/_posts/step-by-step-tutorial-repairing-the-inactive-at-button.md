### Way 1: Hard reset your computer

 This is the first thing you can try when your computer didn’t restart or couldn’t enter the Windows system normally.  
 To hard reset your device:

1. Press and hold the **power button** of your computer until it’s turned off.
2. Disconnect the **power cable** and the **battery** (if any) from your computer.
3. Leave your computer for over **1 minute** .
4. Re-connect the **power cable** (and the **battery** ) to your computer.
5. Turn on your computer.

 Then check to see if you can get into the Windows system as usual. If not, don’t worry, try the next one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Way 2:[Enter safe mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Safe mode is a diagnostic mode of Windows. When the hard reset doesn’t work, you need to enter Safe mode to trigger the problem. Safe mode will be running with a minimal set of drivers and services which is easier for you to identify the problem.

 If you’re able to enter safe mode and see your screen, try the fixes below to get rid of the RSOD (Red screen of death) issue.

1. **[Update your device drivers](#f4)**
2. **[Revert your system from a restore point](#f7)**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Step 2: Try these fixes

 When you enter the Windows system, you can try these fixes. The aim of fixes is to prevent RSOD from happening again. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Stop overclocking**](#f1)
2. [**Check your hardware devices**](#f2)
3. [**Update your device drivers**](#f4)
4. **[Update your BIOS](#f6)**
5. [**Repair system files**](#f5)
6. [**Revert your system from a restore point**](#f7)
7. [**Reset or reinstall Windows**](#7)

### Fix 1: Stop overclocking

 Overclocking is a way to improve the performance of your equipment. Overclocking CPU or GPU could give you higher speed but this operation could also cause trouble. In the worst case, overclocking will cause harm to your hardware.

 If you were overclocking your hardware and encounter with RSOD issue, you’d better stop overclocking and remove settings from your device.

 To do this, you need to[enter the BIOS system](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then set settings back to default.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2: Check your hardware devices and temperature

 It’s possible that the RSOD problem is caused by your hardware issue or[computer overheating](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . You should take a look at your hardware devices to check for any hardware problems.

There are a few things you should do:

#### Check for connection issues

 Check if all your connections (cable/power/…) are working properly. You may need to try using different ports or cables to fix connection issues.

#### Try a different display

 Test your computer with another display (monitor/TV/…) to see if your red screen issue is not caused by your display.

#### Reinstall your memory

 It is also possible that your RSOD issue is happening because the memory (RAM) on your computer isn’t working properly. To fix this issue, you can try reinstalling your memory:

1. Turn off your computer and disconnect the power cable and the battery (if any) from it.
2. Remove the **cover** on your computer. (You may need to check the manual or the official guides of your product for instructions on how to do this.)
3. Remove the **memory** from your computer. (Check out the screenshots below to see what memory looks like)

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 The RSOD issue could also relate to wrong and outdated device drivers. If that’s the case for you, you should update your device drivers on your computer. It’s no harm to try.

 There are two ways you can update your drivers: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 4: Update your BIOS

**BIOS** (**Basic Input/Output System** ) performs the hardware initialization and jumpstarts the processes during the booting process of your computer. In some cases, the red screen on Windows 10 may be related to it.

 To fix it, we could try updating our **BIOS** .

 Because different motherboard manufacturers have different instructions, the steps below are an overall guide.

**Important** : Updating BIOS incorrectly might incur loss of data or even more serious problems. So please proceed with caution or seek professional help in the **BIOS updating process** .

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **msinfo32**  into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b714e5d73e95.png)
2. In **the information** in **BIOS Version/Date**  and go to the manufacturer’s official website.
3. Check out the **Support** (or **Download** ) section and search for the latest BIOS update.
4. Download the file and install it properly.
5. Restart your computer and check if this **red screen error** appears or not.

### Fix 7: Reset or reinstall Windows

 If all else fails, you may have to[reset Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , or maybe even[reinstall it](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) together. We all know reinstalling will delete all the data on your hard drive, you have to[back up all your important files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) before doing it.

 But treat these options as a last resort, because they both take quite a long time.
