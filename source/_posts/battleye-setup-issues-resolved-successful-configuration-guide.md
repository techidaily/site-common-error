## Method 5: Verify integrity of your game files

 You should have all BattlEye files required before you can install this service successfully. So you fail to install it, you should**reinstall your game** or**verify the files of BattlEye or your game on Steam** .

To verify your game files integrity on Steam:

**1)** Open your Steam client and log in. Under**LIBRARY** , right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)

**2)** Select the**Installed Files** tab, then click on the button**Verify integrity of game files** .

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-1200x610.jpg)

**3)** Wait until the process is completed.

**4)** Launch your game. Then check to see if the error’s gone.

 If this works for you, you won’t see the error again. But if not, you have one more thing to try…

## Method 6: Update your device drivers
