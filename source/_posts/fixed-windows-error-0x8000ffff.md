 In some cases, the kernel32.dll error could be attributed to hard drive corruption.  
**Check Disk Utility(chkdsk.exe)** is a useful tool offered by Windows that can be used to check the hard drive for bad sectors and fix them if possible.

2. Type “cmd” and press **Shift+Ctrl+Enter** together to open **Command Prompt** in the administrator mode.

3. Type the following command line and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.  
**chkdsk x: /f**  
**Note** : The letter “x” means the disk drive that you want to scan and repair for. The tool is often used for the Windows installation drive which is usually C drive. If you want to scan and repair C drive, replace “x” with “c”.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap828-1.jpg)
4. After the scanning and repairing process is done, restart your PC and check to see if the error is resolved.
