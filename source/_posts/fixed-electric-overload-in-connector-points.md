### Fix 1: Plug your keyboard in another USB port

 It’s probably caused by the poor connection. Plug your keyboard into another USB port and check if it does light up. If it does and everything works well, it’s your USB port that has the issue.  
 If it doesn’t light up, move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Uninstall and reinstall Razer Synapse

 Plug your keyboard into another computer to see it light up or not. If it doesn’t light up, it might be a hardware problem and you need to contact Razer support.  
 If it does, the problem might be caused by your Razer Synapse. Then a full reinstall of Synapse can help you solve the problem.

1. Unplug your keyboard.
2. Uninstall Synapse.
3. Press**Windows key + R** together to open the Run box.
4. Type “service.msc” and press**Enter** to open Windows Services. Make sure all Razer services listed are stopped.

### Fix 3: Update your driver

 The problem can be caused by faulty drivers. So one of the things you should do is to verify that all your devices have the right drivers, and update those that don’t.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
