 Windows Secondary Logon allows administrators to log on with a non-administrator account to perform administrative tasks without logging off. The Secondary Logon service must be enabled for Blizzard games to install and run.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ser.jpg)

 Some security programs may turn the secondary logon service off. If the service is disabled again after you’ve switched it to automatic, you must configure your security program to stop disabling the service. Contact your security program’s manufacturer if you need assistance with configuring your security software.
