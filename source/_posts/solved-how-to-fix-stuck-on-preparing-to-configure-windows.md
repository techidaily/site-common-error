## **Wait until your Windows system installed all the updates**

 If your PC seems to get stuck on the screen of “Preparing to configure Windows”, it may indicate that your**Windows system is installing and configuring the updates** .

 If you haven’t installed Windows updates for a long time, it may take some time to install all the updates. So just give enough time to your Windows system to handle all the updates.

 The time it may take depends on your hardware specifications. It is recommended that you wait for**2 hours** . 2 hours later, if the your PC still gets stuck on the screen of “Preparing to configure Windows”, try the next fix.

## **Disconnect all the external devices and perform a hard reboot**

 Since your PC gets stuck on the screen of “Preparing to configure Windows” when you try to shut down your Windows system, in such a case, the only thing you can do is to**disconnect all the external devices** (such as**USB flash** **drives** ,**the external hard disk drive** , etc) and**perform a hard reboot** . Follow the instruction below to perform a hard reboot:

1. Press and**keep holding** the power button on your computer case**until your PC shuts down** .
2. **Disconnect** any external power supply or remove the battery from your laptop.
3. **Hold down** the power button for about**15** seconds.
4. **Wait a few minutes** and then plug in your PC or connect the battery to your laptop.
5. Press the power button again to reboot your system.
6. **Select the option to boot normally** if you get a notice that the computer shut down improperly.

 After you signed in your Windows system, follow the steps below to check if this issue persists:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and type**windows update** . In the list of search results, select**Check for updates** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/check-for-updates.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, click**Check for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/win-11-check-for-updates.jpg)
3. Wait until Windows downloads and installs all the updates.

 Restart Windows to see if your PC will get stuck on the screen of “Preparing to configure Windows” again. It’s recommended that you**plug in your PC** and give your Windows system a whole night to configure all the updates. Normally, a whole night is enough for your Windows system to handle all these updates.

 If your PC still gets stuck when you wake up, you should **follow the instruction above to perform a hard reboot and then try the next fix** .

## **Performing a clean boot**

You may need to   **perform a clean boot** if this issue persists  . The clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to manually disable startups and services so that you can **find out the problematic software that makes your game keep crashing** . Once you find it out, just uninstall it, and then the this  issue will be solved. Here’s how to do it:

 After restoring your Windows system, this annoying issue should be resolved.

## **Bonus tip: Update your driver to the latest version**

 To reduce such annoying problems, in most cases, it is a good idea to update your drivers to the latest version. There are two ways to update your drivers: **manually**  and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually**  – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your device. Be sure to **choose the driver that is compatible with your Windows system** .

**or**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

You can update your drivers automatically with either **the FREE**  or **the Pro version**   of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap19-2.jpg)
3. Click **Update**  next to your device to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All**  ).
