Ensure that there is no**objects (such as a wireless router or a microwave oven)** or**USB or wireless devices (such as a headset or a flash drive)** that may interfere in the connection.

 If you are using a**wireless** controller, you can try re-syncing your Xbox One controller to the console to fix connection issues.

**1)**  Press the**connect** button on your console.

**\*** On Xbox One S, the connect button is a small circular button on the front of the console. On other versions of Xbox One, it is on the side around the corner from the disc tray.
