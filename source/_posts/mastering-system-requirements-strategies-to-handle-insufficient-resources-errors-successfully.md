## Fix 1 Run Windows Update troubleshooter

 Windows troubleshooter is a built-in feature to find and fix things not working on your PC. If you get an error code while downloading and installing Windows update, you can always turn to the Update Troubleshooter for help. Here’s how:

1. Type**troubleshoot** in the Windows search box, and click**Troubleshoot settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-1.jpg)

3. Choose**Windows Update** and then**Run the troubleshooter** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-2.jpg)

 Wait for a while until Windows troubleshooters detect and fix the problems for you. After it finishes, check if the error code 0x800f0922 still persists. If it does, go ahead and try the next method.

## Fix 2 Check partition size

 Windows require a minimum**500 MB** space in the system reserved partition for the system update. So it’s necessary to extend the partition size for a successful update if the partition space is scarce. To check your system reserved partition available size:

1. Type**disk partitions** in the search box and choose**Create and format hard disk partitions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-4.jpg)
2. In the pop-up windows, check if your system reserved partition space meets the 500 MB requirement.  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-16.jpg)

 If it fits the requirement, skip this method and try[other methods](#fix-3) .

 If the space is not enough, use a**free partition tool** to extend the partition size. Most online partition tools support formatting, deleting, moving, resizing, splitting, and merging partitions. Just simply choose, download and install one like[MiniTool Partition Wizard](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&id=driveeasyen165827&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minitool.com%2Fpartition-manager%2Fpartition-wizard-home.html) , and follow its instruction to resize your partition size.

 After resizing the system reserved partition, try to process the Windows update again. If the error code hasn’t been removed, scroll down and try the next fix.

## Fix 3 Check network connection

 Weak network connection and VPN make it slow and unstable to connect to Microsoft Windows Update server. These may get you an update error code. Here we recommend restarting your router and turning off VPN temporarily:

1. **Unplug** your router and wait for several minutes.
2. **Plug** the router back into the power supply. Wait for the network machine to fully boot up.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/router-pixabay.jpg)
3. Test your internet connection by browsing any website. If the browsing speed is slow, try to use a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. **Turn off** your VPN software if you are using any. Then run your Microsoft Windows 10 upgrade again.

 If the upgrade runs successfully, restart your computer and turn VPN software back on. If the network and VPN aren’t accountable for the upgrade error, continue to have another try.

## Fix 4 Check the .NET Framework

 .NET is a software platform designed and developed by Microsoft. It supports running websites, services, desktop apps and more on Windows. If the .NET Framework installation fails, error code 0x800f0922 will emerge in Windows Update. Hence make sure you get it installed successfully, you can enable it manually in Windows features.

1. Type**Windows features** in the search box and click**Turn Windows features on or off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-5.jpg)
2. Check any box related to**.NET Framework** and click**OK** to save the change.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-6.jpg)
3. A pop-up Window appears and choose**Let Windows Update download the files for you** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-17.jpg)
4. Windows will download the required files and install those features for you.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-18.jpg)
5. Reboot your computer.

 After rebooting, try to run the upgrade again to see if error 0x800f0922 disappears. If not, try the next trick.

## Fix 5 Turn off firewall

**[Windows Defender Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows%5FFirewall)**  is developed by Microsoft to protect computers from unapproved access, use, and possible infection. This built-in software, however, sometimes may overreact to block some connection and actions. So turning off the firewall temporarily may help solve the 0x800f0922 error code. Here’s how:

1. Type**defender firewall** and select**Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-7.jpg)
2. Click**Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-8.jpg)
3. Turn off Windows Defender Firewall temporarily for**domain** ,**private** and**public** network settings. Click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-9.jpg)
4. Try updating now.

**IMPORTANT** : Remember to**turn on** the firewalls after you finish the update. Be extra careful in using the Internet during this period as your security may be endangered.

If the error code is still there, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 6 Repair system files

 Damaged, missing or corrupted system files hinder the successful process of Windows update. Your system also needs those intact and healthy files to maintain good running. So we suggest you scan and repair your system files regularly. There are two options to reach that:

1. **[Repair & replace files with Fortect](#option-1)**
2. **[Deploy SFC & DISM scans](#option-2)**

#### Option 1: Repair & replace files with Fortect

[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a powerful all-in-one solution for PCs. Replacing damaged Windows files, removing malware threats, freeing precious disk space, and restoring max performance are part of its jobs. In this case, it can scan, repair or replace any problematic files with the new healthy ones. More importantly, it keeps all your personal files, programs, and user data intact.

To use Fortect to repair your system files:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Fortect.
2. Launch Fortect and run a**free scan** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
3. Once finished, Fortect will generate a detailed report of your computer health, which includes all issues detected.

4. To automatically fix all the issues, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to pay for the full version. It comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

#### Option 2: Deploy SFC & DISM scans

 System File Checker (SFC) is a useful utility that checks for system file corruption and fragments. It inspects all the important Windows files and replaces those problematic ones after scanning.

1. Type**cmd** in the search box and click**Run as administrator** to launch Command Prompt.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cmd.jpg)
2. Type**sfc /scannow** and press**Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-14.jpg)
3. The scan can take up to 15 minutes, so wait patiently and check if the problem is still there after the scan.

 If you fail to run an SFC scan or it doesn’t help the issue, run a**DISM** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool prior to running SFC. DISM is a command-line tool that can be used to fix system problems.

1. Type**cmd** in the search box and click**Run as administrator** to launch Command Prompt.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cmd.jpg)
2. Copy and paste**DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-15.jpg)
3. Type**sfc /scannow** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-14.jpg)
4. Wait for the scan to finish and check for any improvement on the Windows update failure issue.

 If your problem hasn’t been solved yet, continue to the next solution.

## Fix 7 Run anti-virus

 If your computer is virus-infected, some of the tasks may be hard to perform successfully, such as Windows update. Therefore running a system scan to detect and remove viruses may help tackle the problem.

 You can use your preferred antivirus software to run the scan. Or Windows 10 has a built-in tool**Windows Security** to provide protection for your device against threats. Here are the steps:

1. Search for**Windows security** in the search box and click**Windows Security** to start the app.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-10.jpg)
2. Select**Virus & threat protection** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-12.jpg)
3. Click**Scan options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0x800f0922-13.jpg)
4. Select**Full scan** and**Scan now** .
