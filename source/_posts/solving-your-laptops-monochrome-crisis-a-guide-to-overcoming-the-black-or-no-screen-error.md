 You should see the webpage again. Then you can adjust the edge of the window as you like. It’s a temporary fix, you might meet the issue again.

### Method 2: Remove browser extensions

 If you can run Chrome normally, you can try this method first.  
 Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They can let users set up Chrome functions according to the individual’s needs and preferences. However, some installed extensions could be the reason for the “Google Chrome Black Screen” error.

 Therefore, to remove or disable the problematic extension can solve this issue.

1. Double click the Google Chrome shortcut.
2. Type “**chrome://extensions** ” in the Chrome address bar and press **Enter** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chorm1.jpg)
3. Click every blue button to disable any extension listed in the panel.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrom2.jpg)
4. Restart Chrome to check whether the issue is solved or not.
5. If the issue is solved, you’ll know there is something wrong with at least one extension.
6. Enable your installed extensions one by one to find which one is causing the problem. Then disable or remove it.

### Method 2: Add “`--disable-gpu` ” parameter

 Chrome creates a completely separate operating system process for each tag or extra extension you use. If you have multiple tabs open and various third-party extensions installed, you may find many processes running at the same time.

 Multiple Chrome processes running in the background could be the reason for the Google Chrome black screen error. So, preventing Chrome from opening too many processes could solve this problem.

1. Right-click on Chrome click**Properties** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrom0.jpg)
2. On the Shortcuts tab, find Target. Add “`--disable-gpu` ” at the end of the text in the Target box. It should now read: …chrome.exe”`--disable-gpu` .

## Bonus: Update your graphics card driver

 To make your computer screen works better and prevent potential screen problems, it is very important to keep your graphics card drivers up-to-date. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter issues like black screen.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-how-to-fix-google-chrome-black-screen-problem/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
