 Your computer should be started properly. If it’s unable to start, move to the next fix.

 When you encounter this situation, you’d better[boot to safe mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to troubleshoot the problem.

### Fix 3: Hardware issue

 If the above fixes don’t work, it’s probably a hardware issue. If one of the components inside is old or broken inside, your computer may be unable to start. In this situation, if your computer is still under warranty, you’d better contact customer service for help.
