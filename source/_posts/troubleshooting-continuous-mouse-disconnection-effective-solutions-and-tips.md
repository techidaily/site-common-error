### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

To do so:

1. Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c30ff817bf.jpg)
2. Click the **Recording** tab, then click on **your microphone device** and click **Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c319e23198.jpg)  
 If **your microphone device doesn’t show up in the device list** , then right-click on **the empty space**  and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on the microphone device once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .

 If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to check for potential hardware issues.

You can follow the steps below to narrow down and troubleshoot:

2. Connect your microphone device to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your laptop for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC,  you should contact the vendor of your microphone device for support.
