## Before getting started

 Before you get started to fix the mouse problem, it is a wise choice to check your wireless mouse first.

### Check the power of the wireless mouse

 When the battery is emptied, your mouse will randomly stop moving. Therefore, you have to check the power of the mouse. For battery-powered wireless mouse, you can just replace the batteries and check if it works. Or if you use a rechargeable wireless mouse, charge it and check if it works.

### Check if the wireless mouse is damaged

 As time goes, your wireless mouse is consumed. As a result, it may be damaged. Especially, a cheap mouse may have a shorter service time. When your mouse doesn’t work, you can check if your mouse has been damaged. You can connect your mouse to another PC and see if the mouse works. Once it doesn’t work, just replace it with a new one.

## Try these methods

 Here are 7 methods for you to fix your mouse problem. You can just try these methods until your mouse works.

1. **[Change USB port](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Connect to Bluetooth](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your mouse driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Disable the Realtek HD Audio Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable disappearing cursor feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Fix missing or corrupt system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Fix unknown hard errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Change USB port

 Your wireless mouse may come with a USB receiver. Generally, you can plug the USB receiver into a USB port on your PC and then your mouse can work. If your USB receiver is plugged into a USB port but it does not work, it may be due to the USB port. You can just try another USB port.

1. Unplug the USB receiver from your PC.
2. Plug the USB receiver into another USB port and see if it works.

### Method 2: Add a Bluetooth device

 It’s possible that your mouse works normally but it hasn’t paired with your PC. If your mouse doesn’t connect to your computer via the USB receiver, you can do it manually by adding a Bluetooth device.

1. On the keyboard, press the **Windows** logo key and **I** key at the same time to Open **Settings** .
2. Click**Devices** from the menu options.

5. You have to wait for the mouse to appear in the list and then follow the on-screen instructions to pair the device.

### Method 3: Update your wireless mouse driver

 If your operating system has updated but your mouse driver hasn’t updated, your mouse may stop working. So when your mouse does not work, you can try to update your mouse driver.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. In other words, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any drivers that need to update.
