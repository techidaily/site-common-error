### Fix 2 – Update your tablet driver

 A variety of device glitches comes down to the driver issue. If your XP-Pen tablet or pen isn’t working, there is possibly something wrong with your tablet driver and you should update it to fix the problem. To update the driver, here are two options for you: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or[**automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 XP-Pen keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to its official **[support website](https://www.xp-pen.com/download/index)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the tablet driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the tablet driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/de-1-3.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged_Pentablet HID driver_ to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)
