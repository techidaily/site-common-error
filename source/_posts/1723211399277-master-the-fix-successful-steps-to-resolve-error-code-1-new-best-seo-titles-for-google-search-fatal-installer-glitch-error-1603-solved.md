**Note:**  Try the Method 2 if the Method 1 doesn’t work.

2. [Update your SmartAudio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 4) Restart your computer to see if the error messages disappear and if your audio is working properly.

## Method 2: Update your SmartAudio driver

 This problem could be also caused by a wrong, outdated, missing audio driver on your Windows. You can solve it through updating your SmartAudio driver.

 There are two ways you can update your SmartAudio driver — manually or automatically.

**Manual update —**  You can update your SmartAudio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system version.

**Automatic update —**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your SmartAudio manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your sound card, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged sound card driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.
