## Your computer won’t start

 It’s vexing when you push the power button and wait for your computer but it is unable to start. The reason could be various, but to fix this issue you can follow these fixes.

### Fix 1: Check your power supply

 No matter what computer you’re using, a PC or a Mac when you couldn’t launch your computer, check the power supply first. Ensure that your computer has power. Check your PC has plugged into its socket firmly. If you’re using a laptop or Macbook, plug it in and power it up.

1) Turn off your computer completely.

 2) Wait at least 10 seconds. Make sure your power supply has connected properly. Turn your computer back on.

 Your computer should be started properly. If it’s unable to start, move to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Hardware issue

 If the above fixes don’t work, it’s probably a hardware issue. If one of the components inside is old or broken inside, your computer may be unable to start.

But if your PC is out of warranty and you have certain knowledge to check the hardware, you could try to open the computer case to fix it.
