### Fix 2: Log on Zombie first

 If reboot your device and game don’t help, you can try logging into Zombies. This sounds wired, but it seems the Zombies mode is different from the others in connecting mechanisms. This mysterious fix works for many users and you could have a try.

1. Launch COD WW2.
2. Connect to Xbox Live. You may receive the error code but don’t worry, click**NAZI ZOMBIES** .
3. Click**MULTIPLAYER** . You’ll back to the main menu.
4. Select Xbox live.

You should be able to play multiplayer mode.

### Fix 3: Check the connection

 You can only play COD: WW 2 with stable and constant internet. So check your connection from the console and try reconnecting to Xbox live. This bug could be related to the internet connection.

Use a wired connection if you’re a PC player.

* You need to make sure you’ve signed into your system account. If there’s a problem when signing into your account, it’s probably you have connection issues.

**Troubleshooting on** [**Xbox One**](https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/Hardware-Network/connect-network/network-settings#83dc7f0c62b1417fb8f85ef45393a1f1) **/** [**PS4**](https://support.playstation.com/s/article/Troubleshoot-Wired-or-Wireless-Network-Connection?language=en%5FUS) **/** [**Steam**](https://support.steampowered.com/kb%5Farticle.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493) **.**

* If you were signed in but couldn’t connect, you need to check the connectivity alerts on your system’s status page.  
 PS4/Xbox one players are suggested to test your connection to find the culprit.

**Test connection** **For PS4 player**

1. From the PlayStation home screen, select **Settings** .
2. Select **Network** .

2. Go to **Settings** and select **Network** .
3. In the right-hand column, select **Test network connection** , and allow the test to run.

 You may say Windows updates could help you do the job, but Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version and sometimes it won’t tell you your device drivers need to be updated.

 So **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comes to help.
