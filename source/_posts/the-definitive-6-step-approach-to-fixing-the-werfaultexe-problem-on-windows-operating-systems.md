## Mastering the Art of Fixing Windows System Crashes: Dealing with Blue Screen Error 0XC00eby

**0xc0000005** is a commonly seen error code on Windows PC. There are three types of situations where you can see this error code. They are:

 **1)[Access violation error](#a)**  ,  
 **2)[The application unable to start](#b)**  , and  
 **3)[Windows installation error](#c)**  .

 If you are dealing with this error, you can check the methods below that can help you get rid of it.

## 1) Access violation error

 One of the situations where you will see error code 0xc0000005 is when you get an**Access violation error** .

 Access violation error occurs when the program you try to run is attempting to reach a location that is not assigned for it. This can result from various reasons. You can try the methods below to troubleshoot this error.

**a)**  First, you should run your**security software** to**scan out malicious programs** . Viruses or malware on your computer (if any) can affect your system and cause the 0xc0000005 error. You should run a virus scan before going to any further troubleshooting.

**b)** You can also disable**Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** for the program that has the problem. DEP is a built-in feature on Windows for protecting your computer. But some programs are not compatible with this feature and opening it will cause 0xc0000005 error.

 To**disable** it:

**i.** Log in your Windows as Administrator;

**ii.** Press**Win + R** and then enter “_**sysdm.cpl**_ “;

**iii.** Click the **Advanced** tab. Click the**Settings** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59507b4b00aa2.png)

**iv.** Click the **Data Execution Prevention** tab. Select **Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select** . Then click**Add** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59507cc89e487.png)

**v.** Open the problematic**executable (.exe)** files. Then click**OK** all the way out.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59507e3c65465.png)

 **c)**  Sometimes the error appears due to**corrupted Registry** . You can **[restore your Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or check all your Registry entries and remove any redundant one.

**However** , you should note that modifying registry is an**advanced and complicated job** . Any improper manipulation can bring unexpected consequences to your Registry and therefore to your computer. If you are a computer novice, you can find a computer expert to help you solve the problem. If you insist on doing it yourself. It is strongly recommended that you**back up** your Registry before you proceed.

**d)**  In addition to all the causes above, an**incompatible** **RAM** (Random Access Memory, shown by images below, an essential part of the computer) can also result in Access violation error.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59dad370059cc.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59dad3756980a.jpg)

 In this case, you should**completely cut off the power** of your computer, and then**remove** the RAM(s) from your computer or**replace** them with other RAMs.

 (RAM is a hardware component inserted**inside** your computer. You need to**disassemble** your computer to remove or replace it. You can ask a specialist to do it for you, or consult your product manufacturer for assistance.)
