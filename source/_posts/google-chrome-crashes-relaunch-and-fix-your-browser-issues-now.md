### Fix 2: Install the correct latest Wacom pen driver

 Your Wacom pen cannot work issue is probably due to an old, corrupted or missing**Wacom pen driver** . You can easily fix it by updating the Wacom pen driver on your Windows.

 You can update your Wacom pen drivers either manually or automatically. If you have no time, no patience or if you are a computer novice, we highly advise you to use the driver tool to help you find and download the latest driver automatically — **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With its help, you can say goodbye to driver headaches and delays forever.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the **Pro**   version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

* Restart your computer to make the new driver take effect. Then try to use your Wacom pen to see if it works fine.
