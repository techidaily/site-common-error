2. [Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

4) Relaunch your game application to see if it works.

## Method 2: Update your graphics card driver

 This error could be also cause by an outdated, corrupted or missing graphics card driver. You can solve it through updating your graphics card driver. What’s more,**for the best gaming performance** , you should keep your device driver, especially the graphics card driver up-to-date.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your graphics card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update –** You can update your graphics card driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for graphics card, like **NVIDIA** ,**AMD** ,**Intel** , and searching for the most recent correct driver for your graphics card model. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows operating system.

**Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly:

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the Scan Now button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.
