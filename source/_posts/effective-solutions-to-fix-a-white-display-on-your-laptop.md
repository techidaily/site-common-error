4) Check to see if Sims 4 opens.

## Solution 2: Update the video card driver

**Sims 4 crashing at startup issue** is probably caused by outdated video card drivers. So to fix the problem, you can try to update the video card driver.

 You can update the video card driver manually by going to the PC manufacturer’s website or the video card’s manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest driver.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy** .](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
