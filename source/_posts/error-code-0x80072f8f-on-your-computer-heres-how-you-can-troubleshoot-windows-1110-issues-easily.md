## Bonus tip

 You should always keep your drivers up to date as outdated or faulty drivers may cause issues like slow network, malfunctioned hardware, or crashing programs. Updating drivers may resolve many computer problems for you.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website of your hardness, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
