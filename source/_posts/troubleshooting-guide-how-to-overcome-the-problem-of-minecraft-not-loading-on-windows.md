Restart your Chrome and go to the website to see if successfully.

## Method 5: Check the website in your Firewall

Restart your Chrome and go to the website to see if successfully.

## Method 6: Make sure you’re going to the secure website

 To enable users to browse safely on Chrome, Chrome requires websites use trustworthy certificates. A secure website must have trustworthy SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certificates; In other words, if the website doesn’t have a trustworthy SSL certification on Chrome, you may face this error.

To check if a website is secure:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Way 1: See its URL

 Over a secure connection, the address should begin with **https** (note the **s**  at the end).

### Way 2: See the security status on the address bar of Chrome

To the left of the website address, check the security status:
