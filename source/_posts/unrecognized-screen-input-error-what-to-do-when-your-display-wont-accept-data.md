### Fix 1: Force a shut down and restart

As many people have resolved the “**No Pen or Touch Input is available for this Display**” error on their computer by forcing a shutdown, it never hurts to perform a force shutdown and restart your computer to fix it. As the steps to force a shutdown vary from brand to brand, you can consult your computer manufacturer to do that. For example, if you’re using a Surface Pro 4, you can press and hold the**power button**for**10 seconds**, then your screen turns off and shuts down. Then press and release the power button to turn on your Surface Pro 4\. After restart, try again and see if touch screen works now. If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There are something else to try.
