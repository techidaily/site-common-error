## Trouble with Driver Power State Failure? Here’s How to Fix It

If you encounter a blue screen error with the message**DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE** , you can try using solutions here to fix the issue.

[Stop 0x0000009F (DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE)](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stop-0x0000009F-DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE-500x332.png) ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stop-0x0000009F-DRIVER%5FPOWER%5FSTATE%5FFAILURE.png)

 As you can see from the blue screen, the**DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE** error has a value of 0x0000009F which indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state. The error most probably is caused by the incompatibility between your PC’s power management and one or more installed drivers. It normally occurs during one of the following power state transitions:

* Going to or returning from Sleep mode
* Going to or returning from Hibernate mode
* Shutting down or starting computer

**To resolve the problem, you can try updating the drivers.**

 The**Network Card** ,**Wireless Card** and the**Video Card drivers** could most probably be the reason. If you are not sure which driver you need to update, you can try updating these three drivers on each to the latest version and see if the problem resolves. You can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to find and download the latest drivers.

 It can be a little hard to find and download drivers manually. You need to know about your PC information and operating system. So you can use[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to help update drivers. Driver Easy will detect all problem drivers on your computer.
