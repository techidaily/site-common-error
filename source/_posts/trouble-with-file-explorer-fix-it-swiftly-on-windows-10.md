## Before getting started

 Before you get started to fix the mouse problem, it is a wise choice to check your wireless mouse first.

### Check the power of the wireless mouse

 When the battery is emptied, your mouse will randomly stop moving. Therefore, you have to check the power of the mouse. For battery-powered wireless mouse, you can just replace the batteries and check if it works. Or if you use a rechargeable wireless mouse, charge it and check if it works.

### Check if the wireless mouse is damaged

 As time goes, your wireless mouse is consumed. As a result, it may be damaged. Especially, a cheap mouse may have a shorter service time. When your mouse doesn’t work, you can check if your mouse has been damaged. You can connect your mouse to another PC and see if the mouse works. Once it doesn’t work, just replace it with a new one.

2. Click**Devices** from the menu options.

5. You have to wait for the mouse to appear in the list and then follow the on-screen instructions to pair the device.

### Method 3: Update your wireless mouse driver

 If your operating system has updated but your mouse driver hasn’t updated, your mouse may stop working. So when your mouse does not work, you can try to update your mouse driver.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. In other words, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any drivers that need to update.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-15_15-08-24-2.jpg)
3. You can choose to update the driver with a FREE version. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or you can click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-24_08-52-26.jpg)

 After updating your device drivers, see if your mouse problem has been solved. If not, move to the next method.

### Method 4: Disable the Realtek HD Audio Manager
