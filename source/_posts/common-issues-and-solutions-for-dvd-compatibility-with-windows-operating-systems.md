### Fix 2: Update your keyboard driver

 Your outdated keyboard driver may very well be another reason responsible for this **keys not working in laptop** problem if**Fix 1** didnâ€™t help with the situation. We might have to update our keyboard driver to the latest version to make sure problems donâ€™t exacerbate.

 Thereâ€™re two ways you can update your device drivers â€”

**Update your keyboard driver manually** â€“ You can update your device drivers manually by going to the **manufacturerâ€™s official website** (like**HP** for example), and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose **ONLY** drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions.

**OR**

**Update your keyboard driver automatically** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or[**the Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b714ceb240ee.jpg)
3. You can upgrade to **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **ALL**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b5ad5d867f97.jpg) You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.
