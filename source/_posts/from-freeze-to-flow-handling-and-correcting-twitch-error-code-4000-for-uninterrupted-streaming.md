and etc.

[**System Restore**](#3)

**Run SFC Command to Repair System Files**

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)** .

 If the SFC command doesn’t work well, please mve on to the next section to run the DISM command to fix the SFC command problem and then run SFC command again.

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)** .

Wait for a while for the whole process to finishes.
