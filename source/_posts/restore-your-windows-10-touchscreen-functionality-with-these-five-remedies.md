### Solution 2 – Update your keyboard driver

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong between your computer and hardware, such as your keyboard. To get the latest driver for it, you need to go to its manufacturer’s website, search the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32-bit), and download it manually. Then, you need to open the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install the driver step by step.

 If you’re not comfortable playing around with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the**Pro version,** it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back**guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8cee85a5cb2.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to a flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

### Solution 3 – Uninstall and reinstall your keyboard driver

1. Press the **Windows![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4ecde832800.png)**  
 key  
 and  
**R**  to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK**  to access Device Manager.

### Solution 4 – Change language in Control Panel

 Sometimes when you find the **@ key not working** on your keyboard, it may have something to do with your computer’s **language settings** . You can go to the settings and verify your PC’s input language is English.

1. Search**language** via the Start menu, and select**Region & language settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8cdaae8ea64.jpg)
2. Under**Country or Region** , make sure an English-speaking country or region is selected. If you cannot find any, then you can click the**Add a Language** button to add one.

### Solution 6 – Boot your PC into Safe Mode

 If the problem is being caused by malware but the troubleshooter finds none, to better troubleshoot the issue, you can boot your PC into Safe Mode. If the @ key works in Safe Mode, but not in Normal Mode, it means that malware may be the culprit. If the @ key works in neither mode, it can be concluded that the problem is very likely due to hardware issues. To boot your PC into Safe Mode, you can follow these steps:

1. Press**Win+R** on your keyboard to open the Run box.
2. Type **msconfig**  and click **OK.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d0bd09c388.png)
3. At the top of the **System Configuration**  window, click on the **Boot**  tab, **check**  the box next to **Safe boot** , select **Network**  and click   **OK.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d0c0263d34.jpg)  
**Note:** If you want to start Windows in**Normal Mode** , ensure the**Safe boot** box is**unchecked** .
4. Make sure all the currently open files are saved and click   **Restart.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d0c41804c9.png)
5. Check if the @ key is working.  
   * If the @ key is working, you can download an antivirus to scan your PC in Safe Mode. Then, go back to step 3),**uncheck** Safe boot, click**OK** and restart your PC to check if the @ key not working problem is resolved in Normal Mode.  
   * If the @ key is not working, you can go back to step 3) and uncheck Safe boot to restart your PC normally. Then continue the troubleshooting with the last solution.

---

### Solution 7 – Use a different keyboard

 If the above methods don’t work for you, you can connect a different keyboard to your computer to see if the @ key works.
