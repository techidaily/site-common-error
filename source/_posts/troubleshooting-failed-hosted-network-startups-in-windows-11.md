 For DVD bootable way:  
  
 Insert the DVD to the computer that has the problem. Wait until you see the message “Press any key to boot from CD or DVD”. Press any key to continue. If you don’t see this message, you probably have to change the boot order in the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) .

 After entering Windows, run a disk check to check if there is any problem with the disk, and run a system file check to check if some system files are corrupted. If neither of them work, try to restore Windows registry.

 Follow steps below:  
  
 1\. Open[**Command Prompt**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) as an administrator.
  
 2\. Type**chkdsk /f /r** and hit**Enter** . You need to wait a while until the process completes.
