## Method 1: Run troubleshooter

 Windows has built-in troubleshoot to fix the common error in the operating system. This issue may due to hardware conflicts. To solve the problem, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Here’s how:

1. Type “troubleshoot” in the search bar and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/8.23.1.jpg)
2. Find**Hardware and Devices** then click.
3. Click**Run the troubleshooter** .

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Relaunch your computer and check the issue is resolved or not.

 If you fail to find Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in Control Panel, that’s probably because your computer version is after **Windows 10 build 1809** . The version has removed the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Don’t worry, you can still run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in this way:

1. Right-click on the**Start** button, then click**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2020-05-07_15-52-49.jpg)
2. Copy and paste**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the PowerShell, then press the**Enter** key.

3. You’ll see the**Hardware and Devices** window popping out. Click**Next** .

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to uninstall it.
6. Reboot your computer.

### Step 2: Download AOC USB monitor driver

 There are two ways you can update your AOC USB monitor drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-aoc-usb-monitor-not-working-on-windows-10/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 AOC keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **AOC** website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

1. Go to the **[AOC service center](http://us.aoc.com/en/service)**  .
2. Search for the monitor on the webpage.

3. Click **Support** .

5. Click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update AOC USB monitor drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/img_5bbdbfffb0e24.jpg)
3. Click the Update button next to your **AOC monitor** to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
