## Expert Tips for Resolving Persistent Keyboard Typos - Learn Effective Techniques Now

 Your keyboard keeps typing wrong letters? This is extremely annoying and you’re certainly not the only one who faces it. Many Windows users are reporting this issue. But the good news is that you can fix it. Here are 6 fixes to try.

## Fixes to try

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Disable Numlock](#a)**
2. **[Switch between your active keyboard layouts](#b)**
3. **[Run the keyboard troubleshooter](#c)**
4. **[Update your keyboard driver](#d)**
5. **[Check for Windows updates](#e)**
6. **[Reconnect your keyboard to your computer](#f)**

### Fix 1: Disable Num Lock

 If your keyboard starts typing numbers instead of letters, you probably enable Num Lock by mistake. In this case, disabling Num Lock can fix your problem. Here is how to do it:

* On your keyboard, press the**FN** key and**NUM** key at the same time. Then, try typing a word to test your issue.

* **If you don’t have a NUM key** (if you’re using a laptop), you’ll need to press the**FN key** and the**CAPS Lock key** instead.

### Fix 2: Switch between your keyboard layouts

 If you have more than one keyboard layout installed on your computer, chances are you have inadvertently changed your keyboard layout. But don’t worry, you can fix it. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Click the language button on the taskbar.

**2)** Switch to another input language and then switch back. (In my case, I’ll change the input language to German, then change it back to English.)

**3)** Check your keyboard to see if this fixed your issue.

 If your keyboard map still won’t match the letters on your keys, move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 3: Run the keyboard troubleshooter

 Another quick fix to this issue is running the Windows troubleshooter to detect and fix your problem. Follow the instructions below to see how to do it:

 **What is Windows keyboard troubleshooter?**
 The keyboard troubleshooter is a Windows built-in utility that can detect and fix common keyboard errors automatically.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**troubleshoot** . Then, select**Troubleshoot settings** .

### Fix 4: Update your keyboard driver

 This problem might occur if you’re using a faulty keyboard driver, or it’s outdated. To keep your keyboard functioning properly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver at all times.

There are two ways you can get the right driver for your keyboard:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#d1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#d2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your keyboard keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer support website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your keyboard driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your keyboard driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)**  Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-229.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://vapordna.pxf.io/vnbxna) .

 Restart your computer after you update your keyboard driver. After your computer restarts, check if your issue has been resolved. If not, try the fix below.

### Fix 5: Check for Windows updates

### Fix 6: Reconnect your keyboard to your PC
