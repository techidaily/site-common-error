### Fix 1: Reinstall your battery

 In many cases, a poor connection between the battery and motherboard is the root cause of this issue. To see if that’s the problem for you, you need to reinstall your battery. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Turn off your computer.

**2)** Remove your**battery** and**AC adapter** .

**3)** Reconnect your**battery** and**AC adapter** to your computer. Then, plug the**AC adapter** back into the power outlet.

 Restart your computer and check if it can detect your battery now. If not, read on and try the fix below.
