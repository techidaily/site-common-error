## Method 2: Change your power settings

 If your power supply unit (PSU) isn’t enough for your computer components, this problem might appear. So make sure your PSU is enough to power up your graphics card. It is also possible that you have a failing PSU. To test it, you could diagnose it with a power supply tester.

1. Type “control panel” in the search box and press **Enter** .
2. Set the Control Panel view by **Large icons** and click **Power Options** .

7. Save the changes and reboot your PC.

## Method 3: Prevent overheating

 If your PC is overheating, you’ll meet a reboot problem while playing a game. Because when the CPU gets too busy it causes high energy and produces heat, your PC will shut down automatically to protect itself. Therefore, to prevent this situation from happening, you have to clean your PC. Clean the dust in your PC and check all the fans are working properly.

 Also, you can use free tools like [HWMonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) or [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads) to tell whether your computer CPU, the CPU core, and the GPU are running too hot.

 Here is a detailed post with more detailed information if your computer is overheating and how you can do about it: [**How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 If your PC is clean and all the fans are working properly, but the CPU is still overheating, then maybe it’s time to change your CPU cooler.

## Method 4: Run a RAM check

 The fact your computer randomly restarts could mean there’s a problem with its Random Access Memory (RAM). Fortunately, Windows comes with a tool that can test your RAM and let you know if there are any issues with it. Here’s how to use it:

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and **R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **mdsched.exe** , then click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_15-53-32.jpg)
3. Click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** .  

 **IMPORTANT: Make sure to save all your work before restarting.**

8. If you see “no errors”, your RAM is functioning well and is not the culprit to the Windows 10 computer randomly restarts problem. In that case, please move on to the next fix.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_16-00-48.jpg)

 If you do see an error, you may consider replacing your RAM sticks. You will need to check if your device is still under warranty or consult your machine’s manufacturer for assistance if you’re not tech-savvy enough to do this on your own.
