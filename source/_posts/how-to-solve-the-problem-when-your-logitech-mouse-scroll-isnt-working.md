## Method 3: Update the driver of your touch screen

**Diver Easy** can automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2** clicks (and you get**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee):
