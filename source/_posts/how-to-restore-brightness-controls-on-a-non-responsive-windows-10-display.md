## Fix 1: Update your device drivers

If you got the mic-not-working issue after having Windows Updates, it’s possible that the drivers (especially the sound card driver) you’re using currently are out-dated, missing, or incompatible with your system. In case you’re not sure whether all the drivers are working fine, you should check.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, one device at a time. But this takes a lot of time and patience, and if any of your drivers do happen to be out of date, you’ll need to manually update them, which is difficult and risky. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually,   **you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just two clicks (and you’ll get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Fix 4: Modify privacy settings

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to fire up the **Settings** window. Then, select **Privacy** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-365.png)

 2) On the **Microphone** tab, in the results pane, click **Change** to see if the toggle for **Microphone access for this device** has been set to Off. If it is, simply turn it**on** .

 Below you’ll see another toggle for **Allow apps to access your microphone** . Also turn it**on** if it’s been set to Off.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-368.png)

 3) Scroll down and head over to **Choose which apps can access your microphone** . Make sure all the apps you need can access the mic.
