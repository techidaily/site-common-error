### Fix 5: Reinstall Skype

 If all else fails, then chances are you didn’t give Skype proper permissions or there are some misconfigurations that account for the mic not working issue. So you should reinstall the app and see if it fixes the problem.

 It’s highly recommended you download the latest version off **[the official website](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/)**  for security concerns.

 After that, don’t forget to launch Skype and check if it’s working as you expect it to.
