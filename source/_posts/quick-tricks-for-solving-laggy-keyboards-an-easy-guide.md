### Common Method 1: Reboot your computer

 Reboot your computer normally can solve many common errors. Shutdown your computer, take out the battery, wait for few seconds then put it back and reboot your PC.  
 After that, check the keyboard backlight again.

### Common Method 2: Check your driver

 It’s possible that the keyboard backlight not working issue is caused by certain driver issue.

 Take the ASUS notebook as an example, the ATK driver directly influences the keyboard backlighting. But how do you know the problem is caused by the driver, not by others? Here’s how:

#### Step 1: Examine your computer

 You need to examine the problem to know whether it’s a hardware issue or driver issue.  
 To do this, you need to enter it’s BIOS system.

**Here’s how:**

1. Shut down your computer completely.
2. Press the Power button to open it.
3. When you see the loading screen, keep pressing**F2** hotkey.
4. In the BIOS system, press the key**Fn + F3/F4** together to check your keyboard backlight can be turned on or not.

 If the keyboard backlight doesn’t work or can’t be adjusted, the reason probably is the hardware issue. You can contact the manufacturer’s customer service or bring your computer to your local computer service center for help.

 If it’s work in the BIOS system, you need to update the ATK driver package.

#### Step 2: Update the driver

 ATK driver is the driver produced by ASUS in order to control the ASUS keyboard hotkeys. So if the ATK is outdated or missing, your keyboard backlight could have trouble and cause you problem.

 There are**2** ways you can update the ASUS ATK drivers: manually and automatically.

**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 ASUS keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **ASUS**  website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

1. Go to[ASUS official download page](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/) .
2. Enter your model name and search or select the product in the drop-down menu.

3. Click**Driver & Utility** .
4. Select the operating system you’re using and then find the driver you need in the below menus.

5. Download and install the ATK driver manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically update the ATK drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the Update button next to your **ATK** driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

## Tips for keyboard maintenance

 1\. Try not to eat, smoke or drink on top of the keyboard to keep it clean.

 2\. Please do not keep hitting the keyboard vigorously. This will cause damage to the soft glue that supports the keyboard keys.

 3\. Clean the keyboard regularly. The dust in the button gap will accumulate and result in some malfunction of the keyboard if you didn’t clean the keyboard for a long time.
