### Fix 1\. Unplug any USB or DVD drive

 If you have plugged in any removable flash drives like USB or DVD, make sure to unplug them and then try to reboot your Windows 10\. It’s possible that your system is trying to boot from one of the connected devices due to modification in boot priority.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-17.png)

After removing all these devices, check if the error still persists.

 If you see the error again, there might be something wrong with your hard drive or configuration. You can move on to the next fix to solve the problem.

---

### Fix 2\. Shut down your computer and cool it down for several hours

 Once _**A disk read error occurred**_ pops upon your Windows 10, you need to shut down your computer and cool it down for a few hours like 5-8 hrs to give it a rest. After cooling down, turn on your computer to see if you can access Windows 10 normally.

 It’s very likely that the temperature is causing the error. However, cooling down your computer takes for hours, you can skip to the next fix if you’re in a rush.

 If the your computer works properly, you need to back up your data and files to an external drive immediately before bumping into the same problem again.

### Fix 4\. Check your hard drives cables

 Check the cables connect your computer’s hard drives to your computer’s motherboard under its hood. If the cable is loose or defective, disk errors may occur.

 In this case, open your computer’s hood and check if each cable is fastened on both ends. Disconnect them, inspect the cables for any damage and then connect them firmly. Be sure to**replace the faulty cables** if you find any.

### Fix 5\. Test RAM memory

 RAM(Random Access Memory) problem brings about various issues. As the RAM memory test is easy and non-destructive, you may as well do a complete test for RAM memory to fix the disk error.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-3.jpg)

* If you’ve added new RAM memory to computer recently, try to remove it and leave only one RAM. Then restart computer to check if the error still occurs.
* Leave one RAM module on one slot and restart computer. If the disk read error still occurs, move the RAM to the other slot and start computer again.

 Now you can see if you can boot into Windows again. If not, don’t give up here, you can try the next fix to solve the problem.
