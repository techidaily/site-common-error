You may encounter an error with a code of **1603** when you are attempting to install something on your Windows. The error message is basically something like “**Error: -1603 Fatal error during installation.**” It usually occurs when you are using a Windows Installer package to install the program. You can try the methods below that can be help you fix the error. **1)[Change installation location](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   **2) [Completely uninstall the same program installed](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   **3)[Start and re-register Microsoft Installer service](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   **4)[Acquire full permissions on the drive for installation](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1) Change installation location

You may encounter an error 1603 because the installation location is you choose is not available due to various reasons — such as being encrypted. You can use another installation folder to install the program and see if the error is gone.

## 2) Completely uninstall the same program installed

If you have previously installed the same program (or its earlier version), the error can occur when you try to install the application again. If you want to install your program successfully, you need to perform a **clean uninstall** of the one installed on your computer. This means you need to remove all the temporary files and preferences it leaves in addition to the major program. Sometimes you may lose the desktop shortcut of a program due to some reasons and therefore you may forget that you have installed it. In this case you can go to**Control Panel**to check if it is still on your computer: Press**Win + R**, and enter “ _**control**_“;
