### Method 1: Remove browser extensions

 Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They can let users set up Chrome functions according to the individual’s needs and preferences.  
 However, some installed extensions could be the reason for the “Google Chrome is unresponsive. Relaunch now?” error. Therefore, to remove or disable the problematic extension can solve this issue.

1) Double click the Google Chrome shortcut.

2) Type “chrome://extensions” in the Chrome address bar and press**Enter** .

 3) Restart Chrome and open a URL in the third-party to check whether the error will appear or not.  
 If the error is solved, you’ll know there is something wrong with at least one extension.

### Method 2: Turn off the**Help improve Chrome’s features and performance** option

 Google Chrome has a default setting that will automatically send diagnostic information to Google when your Chrome is crashed. Google uses this information to release a better Chrome version in the future.  
 But sometimes, it could lead to the unresponsive error. Turn off this option to see if the error is fixed.

1) Double click the Google Chrome shortcut.

2) Hit the three dots button in the upper right corner, then click**Settings** .

 2) Hit the three dots button in the upper right corner, then click**History** \>**History** .

### Method 5: Add`“--process-per-site”` parameter

 Chrome creates a completely separate operating system process for each tag or extra extension you use. If you have multiple tabs open and various third-party extensions installed, you may find many processes running at the same time.  
 Multiple Chrome processes running in the background could be the reason for the unresponsive error. Therefore, preventing Chrome from opening too many processes could solve this problem.

 1) Right-click on your Google Chrome shortcut and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5.5-2.jpg)

 2) Under the**Shortcut** tab, add`“--process-per-site”` in the Target box and then click**Apply** .  
 Next, a window will appear. Click**Continue** , then click**OK** .  
**Note** : There’s a space before`“--process-per-site”` .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5.11.jpg)

 3) Restart Chrome and open a URL in the third-party app to check whether the error will appear or not.

**Note** : If this method works for you, you should start Chrome with this shortcut every time.

---

### Method 6: Rename the Google Chrome profile

 Corruption of Chrome’s system default files could also cause this error. You can create a new Chrome profile to solve it by simply renaming the Default folder.  

1) Make sure your Google Chrome is closed completely.

2) Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

3) Type “%LOCALAPPDATA%” and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/run.jpg)

 3) Double click**Google** \>**Chrome** \>**User Data** to locate the**Default** folder.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5.12-1.jpg)

 4) Rename Default folder into_Default backup_ .

 5) Relaunch your Google Chrome. It’s now reset. Open a URL in the third-party app to check the error will appear or not.
