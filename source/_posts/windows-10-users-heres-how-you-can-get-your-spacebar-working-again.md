## Corsair HS50 Not Working? Here's How to Get Your Mic Up and Running Again

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/corsairhs50-819x1024.jpg)

 You and your friends are playing games together on the internet. But you can only hear your friends chatting from your headset and can’t join them because of your**Corsair HS50 mic is not working** . You must be very frustrated. Don’t worry, you can use solutions in this article to fix this problem.

Before you start:

## Check your device first

**Check your device’s connection** : The mic on the Corsair HS50 is removable, so check your mic connection. And if your PC/laptop doesn’t utilize 2-in-1 mic/stereo jacks, you will need to use the Y-cable to plug them in separately in their appropriate jacks.  

**Make sure you didn’t mute the mic on the left earcup.**

 **Plug your headset into another device (e.g., your mobile phone) to check** :

* If your microphone is not working well, it could be an issue with your mic boom. Then you should contact Corsair for support or have your headset serviced.
* If it works well on another device then it’s definitely not your device’s problem. Try the below fixes.

### **Fix 2: Change the audio settings on your PC**

 If there’s nothing wrong with your driver, the audio settings on your PC may be the reason for the problem. You can try changing your audio settings to fix this problem.

1. Right-click on the volume icon on your notification area and click**Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-7.jpg)
2. Click the**Recording** tab, and check if your microphone is set as default. (There will be a green checkmark next to it and the Set Default button is grayed out.) If your mic is not the default device, click**Set Default** to set it as default.  
**Note:** The device name might not be Microphone and the icon might not be the shape of a Microphone in your computer.
3. Click your default microphone then click the**Properties** button.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/a.jpg)
4. Click the**Levels** tab, then drag the slider towards the largest value.  
 You can drag the slider to unmute and adjust your microphone.

5. Click**OK** to save your settings.

 Now that the microphone of your headset is set as the default device, and you’ve turned up your microphone volume, try it and see if it works. If it does, then you’ve solved the problem.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 If your microphone is not working when used on your PC, this glitch could be caused by an old, wrong or missing audio driver. You should update the audio driver to make sure the communication is fine between your PC and mic.  
 There are two options to update your audio driver: manually and automatically.

**Manual driver update:** You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website to find the correct and latest audio driver for your device. Be sure to choose the driver that is compatible with your Windows system.

**Automatic driver update:** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact audio card, and your Windows system, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/a5.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).  
 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/a6-1.jpg)
