## 1\. Reinstall ftdibus.sys driver

 ftdibus.sys is a system file for FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) USB devices, which are usually preinstalled on your computer chipset. So you may not recall using FTDI USB devices yourself, which makes it quite hard to update or reinstall the driver. But things don’t have to be like this: follow the instructions below to see how you can reinstall the ftdibus.sys driver:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time. Type**cmd** and hit**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to open Command Prompt as administrator. When prompted for permission, click**Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-49.png)
2. Type this command:**`pnputil.exe -d oem<NUMBER>.inf`** and hit**Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The <NUMBER> here should be filled with the number you see on your computer. For instance, I’m seeing**51** , so my command should be**`pnputil.exe -d oem51.inf`** .

3. This is how the command looks like on my computer. Hit**Enter** when the command is typed in.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-51.png)
4. When you see**Driver package deleted successfully** , restart your computer for the ftdibus.sys driver to be install automatically by Windows again.

 Go go the Core Isolation window again to see if the fdtibus.sys driver is still regarded as an incompatible driver that stops Memory Integrity from turning on. If so, please move on.

## 2\. Update ftdibus.sys driver

 If the ftdibus.sys driver reinstall done by Windows doesn’t help, you can then try to update the driver.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your fdtibus.sys driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your ftdibus.sys driver manually

 If you’re tech-savvy enough, you can spend some time updating your ftdibus.sys driver manually.

To do so:

1. Go to [**FTDI driver download center**](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) .
2. Select from**VCP Drivers** ,**D2XX Drivers** or**D3XX Drivers** first to go to the corresponding download page.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-53.png)
3. Click to download the driver that works for your OS.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-54.png)
4. When the driver download is done, unzip or extract the driver file folder, and right-click the**ftdibus.inf** file and select**Install** to run the driver installation.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-55.png)
5. Restart your computer for the change to take effect.

 Kindly note that you should know the **hardware device model** and your **computer system** (Windows 11, Windows 10, or Windows 7, and 32 bit or 64 bit) when selecting which download page to do to and which device driver to download.

### Option 2: Update your ftdibus.sys driver automatically (Recommended)

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)
