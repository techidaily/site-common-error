## Fix 8: Update your audio and graphics drivers

 Here are two options you can take to update your drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Option 1: Manually update your drivers

 To manually update your audio and graphics drivers, you need to navigate to the official websites and download the correct drivers compatible with your system.

 Here are some main manufacturers of audio and graphics drivers. Simply click on the links based on your own need and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the correct drivers.

**Audio** **drivers**

[Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads)

**Graphics drivers**

[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/)
[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29804/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-15-40-?product=80939)

### Option 2: Automatically update your drivers (recommended)

 If you update the drivers on your own, you might risk downloading the wrong versions. So if you don’t feel like doing it, we recommend you use[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a useful tool that detects, downloads and installs the correct drivers for your computer. With Driver Easy, updating drivers becomes quite easy.

You can follow the steps below:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
  
![update drivers; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/driver-easy-scan-now-1.jpg)
  
 3) Click the **Update** button next to the video driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

OR

 Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) with **full support**  and a 30-day **money-back guarantee** and You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Fix 9: Remove audio hardware

 If neither**setting your audio device as the default device** nor**updating drivers** help solve the problem, you should remove your audio hardware. Hardware such as headphones or external speakers could be interfering with your streaming. In order to prevent the conflict, you should remove the audio hardware and try loading the stream again. If the error disappears, you can plug it back.

## Fix 10: Switch to the Twitch desktop app

 If none of the methods listed above work for you, then you should use the Twitch[desktop app](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads/) . Compared to the web version, the Twitch desktop app has proved to have better performance and it brings better responsiveness.
