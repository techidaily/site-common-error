 If you are seeing an**access denied** file or folder error on your Windows system, you are not alone. Many Windows users have got it. This usually occurs when they are accessing or making changes to a file or folder. Sometimes the error appears when upgrading from a previous version of Windows.

**Why does the error appear?**
