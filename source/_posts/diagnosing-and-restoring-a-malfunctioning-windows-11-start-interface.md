## Fixes for the spacebar not working

1. [**Check the Sticky Keys feature**](#method1)
2. [**Roll back your keyboard driver to an earlier version**](#method2)
3. [**Do a clean install for your keyboard driver**](#method3)

### Fix 1: Check the Sticky Keys feature

 The Sticky Keys feature enables you to press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts. As a lot of users reported, the disable Sticky Keys feature helps them save their spacebar back to life. So when you find your spacebar not functioning, the first quick fix you can try is to check the Sticky Keys.

 1) Press the**Windows** key + **I** key together to open the Settings Window.  
 Then scroll down to find and click **Ease of Access** .

 2) Click **Keyboard** on the left pane. Then check the icon of Sticky Keys. If it’s **on** , set it to be**off** .

 If after making sure the Sticky Keys feature is disabled, you still cannot use your spacebar, try other methods below. The spacebar not working error is probably due to its driver issues. Rolling back its driver to an earlier version or doing a clean install for its driver helps many users fix the issue. You can try to do so.

### Fix 2:   Roll back your keyboard driver to an earlier version

 1) Press the**Windows logo**  key +**X** key together to open the quick-access menu.  
 Then click**Device Manager** to open it.

 2) On the pop-up Device Manager window, find and expand the**Keyboards** dialog. Then right-click on your keyboard software and choose**Properties** .

 2) Right-click on your keyboard driver. Then choose**Uninstall device** .
