 Make your backspace work again by updating the keyboard driver automatically via **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 The backspace key on your keyboard just now stops working. You can’t make any backspace now. I totally understand how frustrated you’re cause I also encountered this problem before. But don’t worry, you _CAN_  fix this problem.

 Here’re 3 easy and quick solutions you can try to fix this problem. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you fix your problem.

 **Solution 1:[Turn off the Sticky Keys and the Filter Keys feature](#solution1)**
 **Solution 2:[Reinstall your keyboard](#solution2)**
 **Solution 3:[Update your keyboard driver \[Recommended\]](#solution3)**

## Solution 1: Turn off the Sticky Keys and the Filter Keys feature

 Sticky Keys and Filter keys are two accessibility functions in the Windows operating system. Sticky Keys allows you to press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts; Filter Keys tells the keyboard to ignore your brief or repeated keystrokes. If these two keyboard functions are enabled, sometimes your backspace key cannot work fine.

 Follow these steps to turn off these two features to get your backspace to work again:

#### Window 10

 1) Type**ease** in the search box from Start. Then click **Ease of Access keyboard settings** .

 2) Make sure the status of Sticky Keys and Filter Keys are all set to **Off** . If you see **On** , switch to **Off** .

 Your backspace key should work now. Check to see if it works. If unfortunately not, please try the next solution.

## Solution 2: Reinstall your keyboard

Follow these:

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/win-key-1.png)**  and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.
