**6)** Try connecting your Bluetooth devices to test your problem.

If your issue continues to occur, then try the next solution, below.

### Fix 4: Update Bluetooth driver

 You might run into this issue when you’re using a faulty Bluetooth driver, or the driver is outdated. Try updating your Bluetooth driver to see if that’s the problem for you.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your Bluetooth: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your Bluetooth, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-02-03_17-09-57.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the Bluetooth driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**4)** Restart your PC, then try reconnecting your Bluetooth devices to test your issue.
