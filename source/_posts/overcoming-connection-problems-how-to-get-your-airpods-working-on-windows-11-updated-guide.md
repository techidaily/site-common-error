 Some users reported that after they updated to Windows 11, copy and paste (mostly the keyboard shortcut) would suddenly stop working on their computers from time to time. It’s quite a common glitch, but not a hard one to fix. If you have encountered similar issues, you’ve come to the right place. In this post, we’ll show you how to fix this problem.

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try all of them, just work your way down the list until you find the one that does your trick!

[1: Close unnecessary programs](#fix1)

[2: Repair corrupted system files](#fix2)

[3: Clear clipboard history](#fix3)

[4:Restart the Windows Explorer process](#fix4)

[5: Restart the RDP Clipboard Monitor](#fix5)

[Bonus tip: Update your device drivers](#driver)

 Before we dive into any advances, you can try to restart your PC first. Sometimes a quick restart can fix many random glitches.

## Fix 1: Close unnecessary programs

 The first fix you can try is to close the programs running in the background. When you have many apps running at the same time, they may interfere with each other and cause random system bugs. For example, some users reported that they were able to fix the copy-and-paste feature after they turned off or restarted their video players or graphics design software.

1. Right-click the**Start button** on your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .

2. Under the**Processes** tab, right-click the process you want to end, then click**End task** .

If this fix didn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Repair corrupted system files

 Broken Window Registry files may cause problems with the copy-and-paste keyboard shortcut. You can try to **run the System File Checker (sfc /scannow) to identify problematic Registry files** . Most of the time, this tool can fix minor issues for you.

 But if the System File Checker doesn’t work, you may need a more powerful tool to look into your system issues and repair broken system files.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**V** on your keyboard to open the clipboard.
2. Click**Clear all** to delete the clipboard history.

If this fix didn’t help, try the next one.

## Fix 4: Restart the Windows Explorer process

 If the copy-paste bug occurs mostly when you’re sorting and moving your files, then the problem is likely caused by the Windows Explorer process. You can restart this process in Task Manager, here’s how:

1. Press**Ctrl** , and**Shift** and**Esc** on your keyboard to open Task Manager.
2. Under the**Process** tab, find**Windows Explorer** , right-click and**restart** the process.

## Fix 5: Restart RDP Clipboard Monitor

 RDP Clipboard Monitor allows the user to share the clipboard between the local and the remote desktop. If this process is not functioning as it’s supposed to, you may encounter a copy-paste problem when you’re using a remote desktop. To fix this, you may need to restart the RDP Clipboard Monitor process:

1. Press**Ctrl** and**Shift** and**Esc** on your keyboard to open Task Manager.
2. Find the**RDP Clipboard Monitor** process, right-click it and then click**Restart** .

## Bonus tip: Update your device drivers

 In general, keeping your device drivers up-to-date can help prevent and solve many random computer issues.

 There are two ways to keep your drivers up-to-date. One is to update the drivers via Device Manager. You may have to manually check every device and update them when Windows detects available updates.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your PC and your Windows version, and it will download and install the drivers correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

 3) For example, I want to update my graphics and network adapter driver here. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged drivers to automatically download the correct version. Then you can manually install them (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg)
