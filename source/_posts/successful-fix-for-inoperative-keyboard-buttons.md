### Solution 3: Update your Dell laptop keyboard driver

 If Windows doesn’t load the keyboard driver for your laptop automatically, you can update the keyboard driver in these alternative ways: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update —**  You can update your keyboard driver manually by going to the official Dell website and searching for the most recent correct driver for your keyboard. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of the Windows version.

**Automatic driver update —** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your keyboard driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact keyboard, and your variant Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the Scan Now button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click **Update All**   to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
