### Fix 3: Update your video card driver

 You could probably encounter this error if the video card driver on your computer is outdated, incompatible or corrupt. So you should**update your video card driver** to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get**full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. C  lick **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 5: Remove klhkum.dll

 If you have to reset Winsock tens of times a day, you need to try this method. What you should do is checking whether you have “klhkum.dll” or not.

 So how to remove it? Follow the guide:

1. Press**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. Click the**Startup** tab and find**klhkum.dll** process.
