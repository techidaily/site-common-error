### Fix 3: Make sure your PC meets the minimum specifications

 If you have tried the above fixes but none seems to work, it’s perhaps worth considering whether or not your PC is equipped to play the game.

 Below I have listed both the minimum (for playable performance) and recommended (for optimal performance) requirements for Windows PC. You can check how your system measures up against these specifications.

| |  MINIMUM**SPECIFICATIONS** | RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS                                                                    |                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPERATING SYSTEM             | Windows 7 64-bit                                                                              | Windows 10 64-bit                                                     |

| VIDEO                        | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 2 GB or AMD Radeon™ RX 560 2 GB or Intel UHD Graphics 630 (45W TDP)    | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 8 GB or AMD Radeon™ RX Vega 64 8 GB or better |
| MEMORY                       | 4 GB RAM (8GB for integrated graphics such as Intel HD Graphics series)                       | 8 GB RAM                                                              |
| STORAGE                      | Solid State Drive (SSD) 100GB available space  Or Hard Disk Drive (HDD) 100GB available space | Solid State Drive (SSD) 100GB available space                         |

 If you’re not sure whether your PC meets the system requirements for WoW or not, just follow the instructions below to check the specs of your PC:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-12.png)
2. Under the **System** tab and you can check the **Operating System**  and **Memory** information on your PC.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-11.png)
3. Click the **Display** tab and you can check what **graphics card** your PC is using.
