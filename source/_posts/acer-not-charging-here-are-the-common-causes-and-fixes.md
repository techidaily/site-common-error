### Fix 1: Disable/Uninstall antivirus software

 Antivirus software aims to keep our computer safe, but sometimes the strict antivirus software could interfere with Netflix and cause Netflix not to work properly. Therefore, disabling or uninstalling the antivirus software and then restarting your computer can help you solve the error.

 If this method resolves the problem, you can install another antivirus software to protect your computer. But if you are fond of the old one, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful in using the Internet after uninstalling/disabling your antivirus software.

### Fix 2: Perform Windows updates

 Sometimes, if your Windows System doesn’t update, then Netflix may have conflicts with the system. So, updating your Windows to the latest version can prevent some problems.

1. Press the **Windows logo key + I** together.
2. Click **Update & security** .
