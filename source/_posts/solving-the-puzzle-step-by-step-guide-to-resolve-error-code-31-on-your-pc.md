##  Method 1: Closing background applications

 You may get the rendering device lost error because there are applications (e.g. TeamViewer) running in the background that are conflicting with Overwatch. You can check the applications running on your computer and disable them one by one to identify the one that causes the problem.

**Be careful!** Don’t turn off any program or process that are essential for your Windows.

##  Method 2: Reset the frequency settings of your hardware components

 Your game may crash because you have overclocked your CPU, GPU, or any other components. You should set their frequency/clock speed settings back to the default and see if this can fix your error.

 If resetting doesn’t work, you can try slightly underclocking your CPU. Lower the clock speed of your CPU a bit, and then check to see if your game runs fine.

##  Method 3: Make sure the SuperFetch service is enabled

 Windows SuperFetch is a component of Windows’ memory manager. You can’t play Overwatch with your SuperFetch turned off. You should check the status of this service and make sure it’s enabled. To do so:

**1)** Press the**Windows logo** key and**R** on your keyboard to open the**Run** dialog.

**2)** Type “ _**services** **.** **msc**_  ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

**3)** Check the**Status** of the service**Superfetch** and make sure it is**Running** .

**5)** Set_Startup type_ to**Automatic** and click the**Start** button. After that, click**OK** .

**6)** Restart your computer. Then open your game and see if the error has gone.

##  Method 4: Update your device drivers

 Your rendering device lost error can also result from your device drivers on your computer, especially your graphics driver and chipset driver. You can try fixing the error by updating your drivers.
