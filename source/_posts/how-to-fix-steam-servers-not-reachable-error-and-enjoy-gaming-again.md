## Fix 1 – Is it a driver issue?

Depending on different situations, you may encounter the **Unable to Contact DHCP Server** error when your network driver is outdated or new and problematic (hence requiring a rollback). There are ways you can do it manually, but if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
