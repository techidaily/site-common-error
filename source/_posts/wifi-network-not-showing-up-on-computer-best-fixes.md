## **Method 3: Update WiFi network driver**

 Wireless network driver allows your operating system to communicate with your wireless and network adapters. If your wireless network is not showing up on laptop, it is probably due to the missing, outdated, or corrupt drivers.

 There are two ways to update drivers: **manually**   and **automatically** .

**Manually update driver**   – You can manually update the network driver by **searching the correct driver**   that is matched with your **Windows**  **OS**   on the **manufacturer’s website** , and **install**   it in your computer. This requires the time and computer skills.

**Automatically update driver**   – If you don’t have time or patience to manually update drivers, you can do that automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will detect the drivers condition in your computer, and install the correct drivers for your PC. More importantly, with Driver Easy, you don’t need to struggle figuring out the Operating System, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes while processing. That will tremendously save your time and patience.

 Here’s a step-by-step guide to automatically updating your WiFi network driver with Driver Easy:

 If the Windows can’t access to the Internet, you can download Driver Easy from another computer. Then install it in this computer. Due to the **[Offline Scan feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  provided by Driver Easy, you can download and install network driver even with no Internet.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy (at first connect your computer to the Internet via Ethernet cable).

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Then Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DE-scan-now-6.0.jpg)

 3) Click the **Activate & Update** button next to your WiFi network driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

## **Method 4: Restart your modem and WiFi router**

 If the problem occurs to your own WiFi network at home, you can also check the WiFi itself to see if it’s your WiFi issue, including the router issue, SSID broadcast and device interference mentioned below.

 This problem can be probably caused by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) issue. Restarting your modem and wireless router can help you reconnect to your ISP. Note: anyone who is connecting to the network will be disconnected temporarily while you are doing this.

 1) Unplug your wireless router and modem from power source (remove the battery if your modem has a battery backup).

 2) Wait for at least 30 seconds.

 3) Plug your wireless router and modem back into power source again (put the battery back to the modem).

 4) On your PC, reconnect to your WiFi network, then see if it shows up.

### **What is WiFi Network Frequency**

**Tips** : If it is the first time to connect to the WiFi, you will need to pay attention to the WiFi network frequency. You can’t connect if your computer uses mismatched frequency with your router’s.

 Usually WiFi network frequency has 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Luckily many routers are **[dual-band model](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-R6700-Nighthawk-Gigabit-Ethernet/dp/B00R2AZLD2/ref=sr%5F1%5F7?ie=UTF8&qid=1542969582&sr=8-7&keywords=5ghz+router&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  now, so it both supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz band. To check your WiFi network frequency, you can go to the router manufacturer’s website. While you can also check your Windows WiFi network frequency: type**netsh wlan show drivers** in the**Command Prompt** and press**Enter** , then it will show you the supported protocols.

 Generally speaking, 802.11a/ac uses the 5 GHz band, 802.11b/g uses the 2.4 GHz band, and 802.11n uses either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band. if they don’t match or include the frequencies of your router, the WiFi network won’t show up on your computer.

## **Method 5: Enable SSID broadcast for your WiFi**

 Service Set Identifier (SSID) broadcast is what makes your WiFi network visible to your network adapter. Once you disable SSID broadcast, your WiFi network won’t show up in the list.

**Tips** : Many people disable SSID broadcast for security concerns. By doing this, they can hide the WiFi network, so the network name won’t be seen by others. But the first time to connect to the WiFi network, you’ll have to configure the profile settings manually, including the network name and security mode. After making the initial connection, devices can remember these settings and will not need to be specially configured again.

 You can try the instructions below to enable your SSID broadcast. The specific interface may vary from different computers. Here we take TP-link WiFi router as an example:

 1) Go and see the IP address, username and password on your wireless router.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e56f9063046.jpg)

 2) Open your browser on PC or mobile phone (connect to the Internet via Ethernet cable on your PC or use mobile phone that has internet connection).

 3) Type the**IP address** in your browser, and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e570830c0e4.png)

 4) Type your **User name** and**Password** , then click**Login** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e42f8c2f134.jpg)

 5) Go to**Wireless** \>**Wireless Settings** . Check the box next to**Enable SSID broadcast** , and click**Save** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e4310d67933.jpg)

7) Restart your PC and reconnect to your WiFi network.

## **Method 6: Check the device interference**

 The WiFi signals can be interfered by many household devices, such as your cordless phone, microwave oven, Bluetooth speaker, etc. because they use the same 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequencies. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1) Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source

2) On your PC, try to connect your WiFi again, and see if it shows up.

3) If the problem solves, it seems to result from the devices interference. Then move your modem and wireless router to another place, so they are not in the same light with the household devices.

 In addition to the way mentioned above, you can also buy a **[5 GHz router](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC1200-Smart-WiFi-Router/dp/B01IUDUJE0/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?ie=UTF8&qid=1542969582&sr=8-4&keywords=5ghz+router&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  or **[dual band router](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-R6700-Nighthawk-Gigabit-Ethernet/dp/B00R2AZLD2/ref=sr%5F1%5F7?ie=UTF8&qid=1542969582&sr=8-7&keywords=5ghz+router&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  , because many household devices use the frequency of 2.4GHz. So using a router of 5 GHz can avoid most interference.

## Method 7: Switch to ChromeOS

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ChromeOSDesktop.jpg)

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…
