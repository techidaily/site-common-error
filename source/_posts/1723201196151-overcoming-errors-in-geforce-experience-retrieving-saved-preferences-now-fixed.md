 It is annoying when you open the GeForce Experience and find out none of your games appeared to be optimized. You clicked on the game, it says: “**Unable to retrieve settings. Try again later** .”  
 Don’t worry, you’re not alone. Here are fixes you can try to solve the problem.  

Before you start:

**Try login with your NVIDIA account.** Instead of a Google or Facebook account, login in with an NVIDIA account sometimes can simply solve the issue.  

## Try these methods

 Here are 5 methods for you to try. You may not need to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Reinstall the NVIDIA drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Reinstalling GeForce Experience](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Disable your Bitdefender antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Deleting Steam User Data](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Restore NVIDIA Control Panel Settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Reinstall the NVIDIA drivers

 The “GeForce Experience unable to retrieve settings” problem is probably caused by the corrupted driver files that simple uninstallation can’t get rid of. You need to clear all the files before you install the new driver. A clean reinstall may help you solve the problem.  

 The Display Driver Uninstaller is a driver removal utility that can help you completely uninstall NVIDIA graphics card drivers without leaving leftovers behind.  
 If you already have Display Driver Uninstaller, you can use it to uninstall drivers. Or you can use Device Manager to uninstall drivers.

1. Launch **Display Driver Uninstaller** . Choose the Safe Mode as it suggested.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ddu1.jpg)
2. Select the driver you want to uninstall then choose**Clean and restart (Highly recommended)** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DDU.jpg)
3. Wait for the uninstall to complete and restart your PC.

 There are two ways you can update your NVIDIA graphics adapter:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1–Manually download and install your driver manually

1. Go to the[NVIDIA official website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) to download the latest graphics driver for your device.
2. After installation, restart your PC and then launch GeForce Experience to check if the error message will appear or not.

#### Option 2–Automatically update your NVIDIA graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You can save more time rather than searching and downloading the right driver.

### Method 3: Disable your Bitdefender antivirus software

 If you have Bitdefender installed on your PC, you may have to stop it. It is because this antivirus software may block your GeForce Experience program and lead the GFE couldn’t retrieve game settings. You can simply disable the Bitdefender to see whether GFE can retrieve and optimize the game.

 If it does work, you may replace the antivirus software or ask the manufacturer’s customer service for help.  
 If this method doesn’t work, you can move to the next solution.

**Note** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.
