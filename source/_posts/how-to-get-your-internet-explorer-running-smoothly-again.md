<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Tip 3: Run System File Checker

 As Internet Explorer is a built-in browser, corrupted system files could cause IE not responding properly. Then you can use **System File Scanner**  to run a scan.

**System File Checker** will inspect all of the important Windows files on your PC. If the Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace it.

1. Type **cmd**   in the Windows search box.
2. **Right-click**  on **Command Prompt**  and select **Run as administrator**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97754fa8fce.jpg)
3. Click **Yes**  at the **User Account Control** prompt.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97756bba070.jpg)
4. Once Command Prompt is open, type the **sfc /scannow**  command and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
**Note:**  There’s a space between **sfc**  and **/scannow**  .

5. When the verification reaches 100%, you’ll see something like this if issues were found and corrected:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 **Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.**  
 If that’s the case, restart your PC.
6. Check if you can open IE normally.

### Tip 4: Disable your security software

 It could also be possible that some piece of your security or antivirus software, say,Trusteer Rapport,  is causing the problem. Try disabling or uninstalling it to fix the issue, as it worked for some users. Here’s how to disable security software:

1. Right-click on the Taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977d9f3f6d2.jpg)
2. Click the**Startup** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977dc8cdc2e.png)
3. Select the program(s) you want to disable and click the**Disable** button in the bottom right corner. Then, IE should open normally.

### Tip 5: **Restore your system to a restore point**

 If none of the above works, you may try using System Restore to undo system changes and sort out the issue. Following are steps of how to restore your system to a restore point.

1. Type **restore** in the Windows search box and select **Create a restore point**  or **System Restore** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977ba6da9ba.jpg)
2. When the **System Restore**  window pops up, select **Choose a different restore point**  and click **Next**  .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977be68701e.jpg)
