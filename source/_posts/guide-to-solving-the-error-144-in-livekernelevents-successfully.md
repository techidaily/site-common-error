 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

### Method 4: Temporarily disable Mods

 Using mods for Minecraft may cause OpenGL errors occuring in your game, as some mods may be incompatible with OpenGL. So you can temporarily disable mods for Minecraft and see if OpenGL errors stop occurring.

 If OpenGL errors stop popping up, then you should find the culprit – mods. You can disable your mods one by one to troubleshoot which mod causes your problem.

 If OpenGL errors still persist, mods aren’t your problem and ensure to re-enable mods later on.

### Method 6: Install the latest Java version

 Or you can manually download Java files from **[this page](https://java.com/en/download/win10.jsp)**  , then follow the on-screen instructions to finish installing.

 Once installed, re-launch Minecraft and see if OpenGL errors has been fixed.
