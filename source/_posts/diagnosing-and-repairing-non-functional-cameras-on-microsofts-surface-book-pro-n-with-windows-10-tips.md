![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_586c9a4e6db41.jpg)

 Windows 10 is equipped with some very handy tools that allow you to solve your computer problems.**System File Checker** and**Deployment Image & Servicing Management** tools are ones of them.

You should consider using these tools when:

**a) troubleshooting a buggy Windows system;**
**b) blue screen of death errors occur;**
**c) applications crash;**
**d) some Windows features are not working properly.**

and etc.

 In this post, we will show you some tools that you can use to solve your computer problems:

[**System File Checker tool**](#1)
[**Deployment Image & Servicing Management tool**](#2)
[**System Restore**](#3)

**Run SFC Command to Repair System Files**

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)** .

 When prompted with the UAC, hit**Yes** to continue.

2) In the Command Prompt window, type in the following command:

sfc /scannow

 Make sure that you have made no typo and hit**Enter** .

Leave the Command Prompt window on until the command completes.

 3) If you see the message saying that   **Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations** , then everything is fine with your system.

 4) If you see a message saying   **Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them** , then you need to go to[**safe mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and run the system file checker again.

 If the SFC command doesn’t work well, please mve on to the next section to run the DISM command to fix the SFC command problem and then run SFC command again.

**Run the DISM Command to Fix SFC Problems**

**DISM** stands for Deployment Image & Servicing Management, which is a tool that can fix component store corruption that prevents the SFC command from working properly.

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)** .

 When prompted with the UAC, hit**Yes** to continue.

2) In the Command Prompt window, type in the following command:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

 Make sure you have made no typo and hit**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_586ca8464439b.jpg)

Wait for a while for the whole process to finishes.

 3) When the whole process finishes, restart your computer. Then run SFC command again so it will help you replace any corrupted files with the correct ones.

 **System Refresh or Reset**

 If the above tools cannot help you solve your computer problems, you can have a try at refreshing or resetting your Windows 10.
