* **[Option 2 – Manually](#option2)**

sfc /scannow
4. Wait a few minutes for the process to complete. Then you may see a message that says **Windows Resources Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them** .

2. Type the specific DLL file that causes the error in the search bar (MSVCP140.dll for example), and click**Search DLL file** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dll-file-2-1.jpg)
4. After it’s downloaded, extract the zip file to any location you like on your computer. Then copy the DLL file from the folder and paste it to**C:\\Windows\\System32** as well as the**install folder of the game or application** that requests the file.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You can restart the app to check again. If the error disappears, congrats! If not, there is one more fix you can try.

## Fix 4 – Update your device drivers

 The code execution cannot proceed error is also likely caused by the driver issues. If the steps above don’t resolve the problem, you should update your device driver to the latest, as this is necessary for the programs to run smoothly.
