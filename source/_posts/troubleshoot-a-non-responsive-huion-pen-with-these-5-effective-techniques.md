### Solution 3: Update your network adapter driver

Your DNS server won’t respond if the network adapter driver is outdated. You can update your network adapter driver manually or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money-back guarantee**):

1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install Driver Easy.

2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/driver-easy-scan.jpg)

3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/driver-easy-update.jpg)  
**Note**: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.  

After updating your network adapter driver, please restart your computer. Try to access the website you want to go to again and see if it succeeds.

### Solution 4: Restart your modem and router

If your modem or router doesn’t work properly, the DNS server could stop responding, either. You can restart your modem and router if you have one to solve the problem.

1) Press the power button of your modem or router to power off, then wait for a while and press the power button again to start it again.

2) Try to access the website you want to go to again and see if it succeeds.

### Why can’t I access websites when the DNS server not responding?

First, let’s figure out what a DNS server is. **DNS (** **Domain Name System)** server helps to translate the website address into the IP address for your browser to connect to.

For example, when you want to access our website: **<www.drivereasy.com>** on Chrome, the DNS server translates it into our public IP address: **144.217.68.24** for Chrome to connect to.

So you may know if there’s any wrong with your DNS server, you cannot access any website on your browser. No exception that if your DNS server stops responding, you cannot access the websites through the Internet.
