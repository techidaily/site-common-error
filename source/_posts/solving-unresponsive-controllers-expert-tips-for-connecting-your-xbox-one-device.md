## **Solution 4: Update the USB driver**

 If the USB driver is missing or corrupted, this issue can occur. To fix the issue, you can update the USB driver.

**IMPORTANT:**  You need to use the keyboard or mouse on the problem computer to try this fix. If you can’t use one of them in Windows,  restart it in[Safe Mode with Networking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then try.

 Before updating drivers, uninstall the driver first. Follow the steps below:

 1) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc** and click the **OK** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8e209798c0.png)

 3) Expand the category “Universal Serial Bus controllers” and locate the device USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller (The name could be different in your case. Just locate a USB device). If you can’t find the USB device under this category, expand the category of Other devices. You may find the device with a yellow mark there.

 6) Click the **OK** button to confirm the uninstall.

### **After uninstalling the drivers, update the drivers.**

 You can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver.  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a5c7ea0bb4aa.png)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to a flagged USB driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

## **Solution 5: Disable the Third Party services**

 The issue can be caused by some of the Third-Party services. So disabling the Third Party services may fix the issue.

**IMPORTANT:** You need to use the keyboard or mouse on the problem computer to try this fix. If you can’t use one of them in Windows, restart it in[Safe Mode with Networking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then try.

 1) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.

 2) Type**msconfig** in the run box and click the **OK** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8db9a4f349.png)

 3) Go to the **Services** tab. Check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** then click**Disable all** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8dc3401983.png)

 4) Click the **OK** button.

 5) When you are prompted to restart your computer to apply the changes, click**Restart** . Then your computer will restart.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8dca75f671.png)

 If the issue resolves after the computer starts, you can try disabling the third-party services one by one to determine which service is causing the issue.

## **Solution 6: Enable Legacy USB Support in BIOS**

 The issue would occur if Legacy USB Support is disabled in BIOS. So enter BIOS (basic input/output system ) and make sure the Legacy USB Support is enabled. The key command to enter BIOS and get to the Legacy USB port depends on the PC brand that you are using. Refer steps below to get to the Legacy USB port.

 1) Enter BIOS (See[How to Enter BIOS in Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 2) In BIOS, use the specific key to navigate to**Advanced** (You can see the meaning of the key command at the bottom of the screen.).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8d3383654c.jpg)

 3) Find Legacy USB Support or a similar USB option. If it is**Disabled** , enable it. Exit after saving the changes.

 Note if you don’t find  Legacy USB Support in BIOS, it is possible that the BIOS does not provide this option and this solution does not work for you. If you are still not sure how to do this, contact the PC manufacturer for further assistance.

 Hope the solutions here help you fix the mouse and keyboard not working issue in Windows 7.
