![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-19.png)

 Vivid visual and auditory experiences play important roles in the joy of gameplay.

If you’re one of the**Steam users** struggling with**no-sound issues** in one or more games, you should check out this post and see whether it can get you out of trouble.

## How to fix Steam games have no sound

 Causes of the no-audio problem often boil down to software incompatibility, corrupted game files, or driver issues. No matter what reason it might be, this post will have you covered. There’re 5 fixes for you to repair this problem, but you don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

 Above all, you should check your volume mixer: first, run the problematic game and see if the volume mixer (you can open it from the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your taskbar) has been turned down low or muted; second, check the in-game audio settings to make sure they’re set up correctly.

### Fix 1: Run Steam & your game as administrator

You can run Steam as administrator either temporarily or permanently:

* **[Run as administrator temporarily](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Run as administrator permanently](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### **Run as administrator temporarily**

 After downloading and installing Steam, there’ll be a Steam icon on your desktop. If you see nothing there, simply search for the application in your Startup menu.

 When you successfully locate Steam, right-click on its icon and select**Run as administrator** . Very simple, right?

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-20.png)

#### **Run as administrator permanently**

 1) Locate Steam in your computer, right-click on its icon, and then select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-21.png)

 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab. Make sure you check the**Run this program as an administrator** box, and then click**Apply > OK** to save the change.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-22.png)

 3) The next time you open Steam, it’ll automatically run under administrative privileges.

 Running Steam as administrator is just the first step. Next you’re going to launch the problematic game under administrative privileges. Even if there’s a game icon on your desktop, you can’t use the same method as above to run the game. In this situation, you should launch it via Steam.

 1) Log in Steam. Then click**LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-23.png)

 2) Right-click on the problematic game. Then click**Properties** .

 If you want to run the game as administrator permanently, please complete the following procedure:

 1) After locating the game executable, right-click on the file and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-79.png)

 2) Go to the**Compatibility** tab. Make sure you check the**Run this program as an administrator** box, and then click**Apply > OK** to save the change.

 3) The next time you launch the game, it’ll automatically run under administrative privileges.

 There you go – now you just need to start the game and see whether your no-sound problem has been solved. If not, please move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Verify integrity of game files

 There’s a possibility that some of the game files got missing or corrupted during the download process. If that’s the case, you should probably use the built-in tool of Steam to verify the integrity of your game files.

 1) Log in Steam and click**LIBRARY** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-23.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-23.png)

 2) Right-click on the problematic game. Then click**Properties** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-24.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-24.png)

 3) Go to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and select**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-29.png)

4) Wait till the process is complete.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-30.png)

 5) When finished, click**CLOSE** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-31.png)

 Now it’s time to launch the game and check whether you can hear audio again. If not, please proceed to the next method.

### Fix 3: Uninstall conflicting software

 As reported by many players, the triggers for their no-sound issue in Steam games turn out to be conflicting software such as Sonic Studio 3, Sonic Radar 3, Nahimic 2, Alienware Sound Center, or MSI Audio. If you happen to be using these apps, the only meaningful course is to uninstall them.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **control panel** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-20_10-55-05.png)

 2) Under **View by** , click **Category** . Then, click **Uninstall a program** right under the **Programs** category.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

Or if you just want to update the audio driver, simply click the**Update** button next to it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-36.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 5: Roll back Windows 10 update

 If you encounter the no-sound problem shortly after you perform a Windows update, then you should consider rolling it back. Depending on different scenarios, you can take different actions accordingly:

* **[Go back to the previous version of Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Uninstall updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Reset this PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### **Way 1 – Go back to the previous version of Windows 10**

 You may restore your Windows 10 system to its previous version**within 10 days** since the last update.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo key** and**I** at the same time to fire up the**Settings** window. Locate**Update & Security** and click on it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-39.png)

 2) Click**View update history** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-40.png)

 3) Click**Recovery options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-41.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Hit the**Get started** button right below**Go back to the previous version of Windows 10** . Then follow the onscreen instructions to complete the whole process.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-44.png)

 If your**Get started** option is grayed out (as appeared in the screenshot above), that means the last update took place more than 10 days ago. In this situation, you should try the next method to roll back Windows update.

#### Way 2 – Uninstall updates

 1) Repeat**Step 1 through Step 2** in**Way 1** . Then click**Uninstall updates** this time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-45.png)

 2) Right-click on the unwanted update and click**Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-46.png)

3) Follow the onscreen instructions to complete this process.

 Now that you’ve uninstalled the latest update, you should check if the no-audio problem still persists. If so, move on to Way 3.

#### Way 3 – Reset this PC

 In this way, your Windows 10 system will be reinstalled so applications including Steam and your PC games will get uninstalled meanwhile. Incidentally, you’re allowed to choose whether to retain your personal files or not.

 1) Repeat**Step 1 through Step 3** in**Way 1** . Then hit the**Get started** button right below**Reset this PC** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-47.png)

2) Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the whole process.

3) When it is complete, you need to reinstall Steam as well as your games to check whether the no-sound issue still remains.

 Windows Support will provide you with more depth on how to roll back Windows 10 update at **[this website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options)**  .
