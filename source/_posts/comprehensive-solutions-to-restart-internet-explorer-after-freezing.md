 Many Steam users are having an issue with their Steam client. They get an error “**Steam Client Bootstrapper has stopped working** ” when they’re trying to log in. They can’t use the client or play their games on the platform because of this error. This is a very annoying issue.

 But don’t worry. The following are a few methods that have helped many Steam users get rid of the error.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Run your Steam client in compatibility mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Temporarily disable your antivirus**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your device drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

##  Method 1: Run your Steam client in compatibility mode

 Your Steam client may not be working well because of compatibility issues. And you should change the compatibility mode setting for your Steam client.

**1)** Open**File Explorer** (press the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard at the same time), then go to where you’ve installed your Steam (the default location is _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\_ ).

**2)** Right click**Steam** (or**Steam.exe** ) and then click**Properties** .

##  Method 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your Steam error is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

##  Method 3: Update your device drivers

 You may get this error because you’re using a wrong driver or it’s out of date. You should update your driver and see if this fixes your error. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
