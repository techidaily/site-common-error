### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

To do so:

1. Right-click on  **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click  **Sounds**  .

2. Click the **Recording**   tab, then click on **Microphone SteelSeries Arctis 5 chat**   and click **Set Default** .

3. Click on **Microphone SteelSeries Arctis 5 chat**   and click **Properties** .
