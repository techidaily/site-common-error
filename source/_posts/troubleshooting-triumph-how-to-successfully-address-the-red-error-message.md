### Tip 4: Update your touchpad driver

 A missing or outdated touchpad driver may also stop your touchpad from working properly. There are two ways to update your touchpad driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your touchpad driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your touchpad. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your touchpad driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
