 10) Insert the battery to your laptop and then reconnect the power plug.

**IMPORTANT:**  Sometimes Windows may not reinstall the battery driver automatically for you. You can download the latest battery driver from your laptop manufacturer’s website.

 If you’re a computer novice and have no idea how to download and install your device drivers, we recommend using [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the **Scan Now**   button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click **Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with [**Driver Easy Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
