### **Step 2: Make sure all the devices are within detected range**

 As mentioned, AirDrop works based on WiFi and Bluetooth, so your devices must be within the WiFi and Bluetooth range to be able to detected. You can’t AirDrop to users who are out of the defined range.

 It’s recommended to be as**closer** as possible when using AirDrop, and do not beyond**20 feet** (**6 meters** ), which may make your device undiscoverable.

### **Step 3: Turn off your AirPlane mode**

 The Airplane mode cuts off your iPhone’s connection to all wireless networks, both cellular and Wi-Fi, so your AirDrop won’t be working if your AirPlane mode is on.

 1)**Swipe** **up** from the bottom of your device screen.

 2) Tap the**Airplane** button to turn it off. The button is grey if it’s turned off.

 3) Try your AirDrop again to see if it works.

### **Step 4: Make sure your device screen is on when using AirDrop**

 If the iOS device screen is off when AirDrop items, you would fail to send/receive the items. So**make sure your iOS device screen is on** when using AirDrop.

 As for Mac, you can use AirDrop when your Mac screen is off, but make sure it’s**not in sleep mode** . Sleep mode will stop AirDrop from working properly, too.
