## Why does the error Failed to initialize renderer occur?

Rendering or image synthesis is the automatic process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D by means of computer programs, and the result of the displaying such a model can be called a render. When launching the game, the game engine would check your video card details, and see what it is capable of supporting. After that, the game engine decides what things to initialize for it. If it fails, it means that the game can not read your video card properly. So it’s probably due to the**graphics card driver problem**.

### Solution 1: Restart your computer

As many technical issues can be resolved by restarting the computer, it’s no harm to restart your computer and fix the**Failed to initialize renderer**error.. 1) Close your game that was giving the error. 2) Shut down your computer. 3) Turn on your computer after a while. 4) Restart your game to see if the error disappears. No luck? Don’t worry. We have other solutions for you to try.

### Solution 2: Install the latest patches

The game developers always release the latest updates to fix some bugs, so you should check whether is any update of the game, and download the latest patches to fix the bugs. After updating your game to the latest version, restart your computer and launch it again.

### **Solution 3: Update the graphics card driver**

As mentioned above, Failed to initialize renderer can be caused by the graphics card driver issue, as the graphics card driver is quite important for inter-communicating between the video card and the games and programs. So if the graphics card driver is missing or outdated, you’ll receive this error message.**Updating the graphics card driver**can effectively solve the issue. There are two ways to update the graphics card driver:[**Manually update the graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [**Automatically update the graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

4) Restart your computer and check to see if you can play the game now.

### **Solutions 4: Validating master files for your game**

It’s likely that your graphics settings are high, or your files are set as read only, so it prevents your game from updating your graphics settings. You can try validating master files for your game to fix it. 1) Close the game and Steam, then go to Steam folder and remove folder named **appcache**  . Steam will create a new folder later later when you open it, please don’t worry.2) Go to the folder of the game that gives the error. It’s normally in**C drive > Users> Your Name > Documents > My games**, or in**Documents > My games**, then click the file that is named with the game. For example, if it’s Skyrim that gives the error of Failed to initialize renderer, you can open the file named Skyrim in Document > My games > Skyrim.

3) Delete the .ini files named with**XXX.ini**and**XXXPrefs.ini**. Take Skyrim as an example, you can delete the files named**Skyrim.ini**and**SkyrimPrefs.ini**.
