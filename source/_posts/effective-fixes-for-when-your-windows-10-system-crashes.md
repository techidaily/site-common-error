## Method 2: Download a new launcher from your Nativelog

Another solution to your**Error Code 5**error is to download a new launcher from the link your Nativelog.txt file provides.

**Nativelog.txt** is a log file created by your Minecraft game. It is at the location of your Minecraft Launcher shortcut (usually on your**desktop** ).

To do so:**1)**Open the**Nativelog.txt**file. Select and copy the**http link ended by “MinecraftLauncher.exe”**.**2)** Open your web browser, then paste the link in the address box and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.**3)** Download the new Minecraft Launcher. Then replace your original launcher in your Minecraft directory with this new one.**4)**Open the new launcher and see if it runs normally.
