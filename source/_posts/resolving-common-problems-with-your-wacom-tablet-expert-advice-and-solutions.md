### **Fix 4: Close FAR(Fix Automata Resolution) Mod**

 Fix Automata Resolution (FAR) is developed by Nier Automata. By manipulating the graphics requirements of the game, users with lower specs can play the game. But FAR can be the reason for the Nier Automata crashing problem.

 If you have already enabled FAR mod, you can disable it and restore the game settings to default to solve the problem. Then restart your computer to check whether it solves the problem or not.

### Fix 5: Change processor affinity
