* **The problem can’t start because steam\_api64.dll is missing from your computer.**

Now check to see if this fixed your error.

### Fix 3: Restore the steam\_api64.dll file

 You can also fix your**steam\_api64.dll** missing issue by restoring the file from a reliable source. To do so, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to[DLL-Files](https://www.dll-files.com/) . Use the search box to look for the DLL file that is missing from your computer.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dll-files-manual-1.jpg)
2. Once it got a hit in the database, you will see the available dll files. You can then click the file and follow the instruction on the page to download the file to the designated location.
3. Note that sometimes you may find that there are multiple files available. Mostly you can simple pick the highest version. But when the versions are the same, it could mean that the files work for different architecture. To find out the architechure of your system (whether it’s 64-bit or 32-bit), you can open[Windows Settings](ms-settings:about?activationSource=SMC-Article-15056) and check the**System type** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/windows-settings-architecture-1.jpg)

 Missing DLL files could imply a bigger issue, and sometimes on the system level. If the problem persists, you can use a system repair tool like[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan for system issues.

Now check to see if this fixed your dll file missing issue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 4: Copy the same file from another computer

 You can also try copying the missing file from another computer. To fix your issue, you should make sure the computer:

* **Runs the same operating system as your computer does;**
* **Has the same game installed.**

To check if the other computer has the same operating system:

1. On your own computer, click the**Start** menu in the lower left corner of your screen. Then type “_cmd_ “, right click**Command Prompt** in the result, and click**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1faa96eb44e.jpg)
2. Type “_control /name microsoft.system_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b208506c0cf0.jpg)
3. Do the**step 1 to 2** for the other computer.
4. Make sure the**Windows editions** and**system types** of both computers are the same. (If not, it’s recommended that you find another computer.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b209503d843d.jpg)

To copy steam\_api64.dll:

1. On the other computer, open**File Explorer** (by pressing the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard), then go to the folder where Steam is installed. (By default, it is_C:Program FilesSteam_ .)
2. Type “_steam\_api64.dll_ ” in the search box.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b235bdb614d2.jpg)
3. Copy the**steam\_api64.dll**  file and paste it to a flash drive or an external hard drive.  
 You should check the location of the file you choose and make sure it is in the directory of the game. And you should also remember the location, as you’ll need to paste the file to the exact same location on your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b235c3e532ad.jpg)
4. On your computer, go to where your Steam is installed, then paste the file to the same location as where you copied the file on the other computer.
