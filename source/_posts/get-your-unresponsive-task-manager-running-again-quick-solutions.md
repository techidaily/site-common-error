![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a6fd4e4c17cd.jpg)

 Oops… The **Shift key on your keyboard stops working** . Neither the left shift key, nor the right one. How could that happen? You may be very annoyed now.

 Don’t worry. You’re not alone. It’s a common keyboard issue. Many Windows users’re experiencing this issue as you do. More importantly, you CAN fix it by yourself.

 This small guide will be showing you how to fix the Shift key bot working issue step by step. Read on and go on with the steps to troubleshoot your problem.

## How do I fix Shift key not working?

A quick check before we start:

**Do the other keys on your keyboard work fine?** — Try to press any other key on your keyboard to see if it works.

 If the other keys work fine, then try to turn off the Sticky Keys feature on your Windows via the**Solution 1** .

If the other keys stop working either, check the next question:

 **Does your keyboard work via another USB port or computer?**  — Try to connect your keyboard with another USB port, or plug it into another computer to see if your keyboard works.

 If your keyboard works with another USB port, then the problem is on the USB port. You can use your keyboard with the working USB port then.

 If your keyboard works with another computer, then the problem is probably due to your Keyboard driver, save your Shift key through updating the keyboard driver via the**Solution 2** .

### Solution 2: Update your keyboard driver

 This problem may be caused by an old, corrupted, or missing keyboard driver. If so, you can solve it by updating the keyboard driver.

 There are two ways to update your keyboard driver — manually and automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your keyboard driver manually by going to the keyboard manufacturer’s website for your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows versions.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your keyboard driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find all the available correct drivers, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. Your keyboard driver is no exception.
