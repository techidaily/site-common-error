## Solution 2: Update the video card driver

**Sims 4 crashing at startup issue** is probably caused by outdated video card drivers. So to fix the problem, you can try to update the video card driver.

 You can update the video card driver manually by going to the PC manufacturer’s website or the video card’s manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest driver.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy** .](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
