Select and copy the**http link ended by “MinecraftLauncher.exe”**.**2)** Open your web browser, then paste the link in the address box and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.**3)** Download the new Minecraft Launcher. Then replace your original launcher in your Minecraft directory with this new one.**4)**Open the new launcher and see if it runs normally.
