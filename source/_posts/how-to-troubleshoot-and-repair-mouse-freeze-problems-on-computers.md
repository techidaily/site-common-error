### Fix 2: Turn off Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your  user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If you have too many add-ons, they can may overload your browser and cause the **Google Chrome not responding**  issue.

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .

3. Toggle off all the extensions on your Chrome.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e199b56ceb.png)
4. **Restart**  your computer and check if**Google Chrome**  now works:

* If Google Chrome does respond after disabling all your add-ons, it’s likely one of your add-ons was the problem. Now you just need to figure out which one. To do this, enable the first add-on in the list, then see if Google Chrome still works. If it doesn’t, then you’ve found the cause of the problem. If Google Chrome works fine after enabling the first add-on, enable the second and test again. Continue testing each add-on in this way until you find the one that stops Internet Explorer from working. Once you find it, disable it again. If you need it, contact the vendor for support.
* If disabling your add-ons doesn’t solve the **Chrome not responding**  issue, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 5: Update or reinstall Chrome

 If all else fails, then we might have to update Chrome to see if there’s any bugfix in it that will solve the Chrome not responding issue.

 Updating Chrome will not touch any of your browser settings or data, and is considered as a safe option in most cases.

To do so:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **help** \>**About Google Chrome** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Google Chrome automatically detects if there’s an update available:  
   * If yes, follow the on-screen instruction to finish the update.  
   * If no, delete Chrome and re-install it on Windows store or other trustworthy third-party website. (**NOTE** : This will erase your Chrome browser settings and data)
4. Check if the**Google** **Chrome not responding** issue has been resolved.
