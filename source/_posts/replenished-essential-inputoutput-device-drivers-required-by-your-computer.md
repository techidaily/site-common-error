**Manual driver update** – You can update your printer driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your printer, say, HP, canon… and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your printer manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
