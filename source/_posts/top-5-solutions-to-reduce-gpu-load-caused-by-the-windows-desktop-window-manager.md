### Fix 1: Check for physical issues

Depending on which mouse isn’t working:

2. Move your mouse and check if the **mouse frozen on laptop** issue has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if the problem persists, move on to**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: **Check mouse properties**

 Another possible cause for this mouse-got-stuck problem is trackpad is turned off. To get your mouse unstuck:

1. On your keyboard, press **the**   **Windows logo key**  , then copy & paste **main.cpl** into the box and click **OK** .
