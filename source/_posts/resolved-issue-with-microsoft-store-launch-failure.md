The article shows you four methods. You may not have to try them all; just work from the top down until you find the one that works.

 **Method 2: [Install system updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 **Method 4: [Reset your Surface Pro 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**NOTE:** Since your touch screen cannot work, you need other**input devices** such as a mouse, a keyboard, a Type Cover, etc, to perform some of these methods.  
  
## Method 1: Perform a two button shutdown

**2)**  Press the**volume up (+) button** and the**power button** together and**hold** them for around**15** **seconds** . (Do**NOT** release them when you see the logo pops up.)

**3)**  Leave your Surface Pro 4 for over**10** **seconds** .

**4) Start** your device. Then try your touch screen and see if it can work.  
  
## Method 2: Install system updates

 Your operating system may contain some defects that disable the touch screen of your device. You should verify that your system is updated, and install the system updates if it isn’t.

## Method 3: Update the driver of your touch screen

 You may not be able to use your touch screen if you are using a wrong or outdated touch screen driver. You should verify that your touch screen has the right driver, and update it if it doesn’t.

 If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Diver Easy** can automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2** clicks (and you get**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install**Driver Easy** .

**2)** **Run** **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button.

Or click the Update All to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click the Update All).
