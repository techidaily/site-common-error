## Try these fixes

 The following are a few fixes that may help you fix this issue. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Restart your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Check your antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Run your Steam client as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Change your download region](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 Restarting is always a good choice to do first. When you restart your PC, it will flush all kinds of system files and release some files occupied by other programs. So after restarting your PC, run Steam and download updates.

If it doesn’t work, move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Check your antivirus software

 Sometimes your antivirus software may be the reason for not downloading updates. So disable your antivirus software and try downloading Steam updates to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Fix 3: Run your Steam client as administrator

 The privilege issue might be the reason for this problem. With high integrity access, Steam can make full use of its features, so run Steam as an administrator to see if this fixes your issue.

1. Exit Steam.
2. Right-click on the Steam icon and click **Properties** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/steam-icon-1.jpg)
3. Under the **Compatibility** tab, tick **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **OK** .

### Fix 4: Change your download region

 Steam provides different content servers in different regions. It is possible that the servers in your region may be slow, overloaded or have a hardware failure which causes the download issues. So you can try to change your download region to solve the issue.

1. Click the**Steam** button on the upper left corner, then click**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/regions.jpg)
2. Choose the**Downloads** tab, click the**Download Region** drop-down menu to choose another server location. Then click**OK** .

3. Check whether you can download the updates. You may need to test several regions to find the download server that restores your speed.
