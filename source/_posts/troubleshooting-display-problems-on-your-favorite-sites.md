 If this method works for you, you won’t see the error when you launch your game. But if it doesn’t, there are three more fixes for you to try…

## Method 4: Run the BattlEye installer manually

 When the game has failed to install the BattlEye service for you, you can install it manually. To do so:

**1)** Open File Explorer (by pressing the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard at the same time), then go to the**BE Service directory** (usually_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\BattlEye_ ).

**2)** Run **install\_BattlEye.bat/install\_BattlEye** . This will install the BattleEye service.

**3)** Run your game and see if this fixes your error.

## Method 5: Verify integrity of your game files

 You should have all BattlEye files required before you can install this service successfully. So you fail to install it, you should**reinstall your game** or**verify the files of BattlEye or your game on Steam** .

To verify your game files integrity on Steam:

**1)** Open your Steam client and log in. Under**LIBRARY** , right-click your game title and select**Properties** .
