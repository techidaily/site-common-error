## Speedy Remedies for Out of Memory Crashes in Red Dead Redemption 2 – Adjust and Overcome

Getting any error codes or messages during the gameplay could be quite frustrating. This happens to some players in **[Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/red-dead-redemption-2?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=b30b6d1b4dfd4dcc93b5490be5e094e5)**  . They receive an error saying**ERR\_MEM\_VIRTUAL\_OF\_MEMORY** , which stops them from continuing the journey. Luckily, it’s fixable, simply by increasing the page file size. But some may need to try other methods in order to get rid of this error. Read on and find out how.

## Try these fixes

 Not all solutions are necessary, so just work the list down until you find the one that solves your problem.

## How to increase the page file size

To increase the page file size, take these steps:

 1) In the Search box, type**advanced system settings** . Then click**View advanced system settings** from the list of results.  
  
![increase the page file size](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/advanced-system-settings.png)

 2) Under the**Advanced** tab, click**Settings** .

![fix Red Dead Redemption 2 ERR_MEM_VIRTUAL_OUT_OF_MEMORY how to increase the page file size](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/advanced-settings.png)

 4) Uncheck**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .  
  
![how to increase the page file size](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/uncheck-the-option-1.png)

 5) Select your C drive and then tick**Custom size** .  
  
![fix Red Dead Redemption 2 ERR_MEM_VIRTUAL_OUT_OF_MEMORY how to increase the page file size](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/custom-size.png)

 6) Type in the values for**Initial size** and**Maximum size** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.  
 (Tips: Microsoft recommends that the virtual memory you set is**no less than 1.5 times and no more than 3 times** the size of your RAM. To check RAM on Windows, follow the instructions below. )

* On your keyboard, press**Windows + R keys** simultaneously to invoke the Run box.
* Type**msinfo32.exe** and press Enter.  

![check RAM](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/msinfor.exe_.png)

* Scroll down and look for the**Installed Physical Memory (RAM)** entry.  

![how to check RAM](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Total-virtual-memory.png)

1 GB (Gigabyte) = 1000 MB (Megabyte)

 So in my case, the recommended initial size is: 8 GB \* 1000 \* 1.5 = 12000 MB  
 For the recommended maximum size, it will be: 8 GB \* 1000 \* 3 = 24000 MB

 After increasing the page file size, launch Red Dead Redemption 2 and you should be able to enjoy your gameplay without receiving the Out of virtual memory error. However, in case your issue persists, we’ve gathered some workarounds for you.

## Change API from Vulkan to DirectX 12

 By default, the API in Red Dead Redemption is set to Vulkan. However, players have found that most of the crashes along with error codes or messages are related to graphics API. To fix it, you can switch it to DirectX 12 and check if your problem is resolved:

 1) Go to the **SETTINGS** menu in the game.

![run DirectX 12 red dead redemption 2 won't launch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Go-to-settings-1.png)

 2) Click **GRAPHICS** .

![run DirectX 12 red dead redemption 2 won't launch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/click-on-graphics.png)

 3) Scroll down to the **Advanced Settings**  section and make sure the **Advanced Settings**  option is set to **Unlocked** .

![run DirectX 12 red dead redemption 2 won't launch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unlock-advanced-settings-2.png)

 4) In the **Graphics API**  section, change it to **DirectX 12**  by clicking on the arrow button.

![run DirectX 12 red dead redemption 2 won't launch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-DirectX-12-1.png)

 5) Press **Enter**  to apply the changes.

 If it didn’t work, attempt to update your device drivers, especially your graphics driver.

## Update your device drivers

 A driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with your hardware. If the device drivers are outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. Therefore, when you experience constant crashes when playing video games,**you should make sure your drivers are up-to-date** .

 You may not be able to fix or prevent every single crash, but updating drivers can help you keep them down. Moreover, **driver updates can give you a speed boost, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features** , all for free. So there are no apparent reasons not to update your drivers.

 To update your device drivers, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact drivers for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an**automatic driver updater** such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as**it will take care of the busy work for you** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.
