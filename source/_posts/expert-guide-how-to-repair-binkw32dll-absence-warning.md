### Solution 3: Copy the physxloader.dll file from your friend’s PC

 If unfortunately, all the previous methods fails to help, you can copy the physxloader.dll file from a PC that runs the same Windows system as yours.

**Part 1:**   Check your Windows system type and find a computer that runs the same system with yours.

Here’s how you can check Windows type of a computer:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**   to bring up the Search box.
2. Type **system information**   and then select **System Information**   from the result.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. You should then see the system type of the computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc461cb24500.jpg)

**Part 2:**  Copy the physxloader.dll file from the working computer and then paste it to the problem computer.

Here’s how you can find the dll file:

1. On the keyboard of the working computer, press the **Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time to bring up the File Explorer.
2. Go to **C:\\Windows\\System32** , then type **physxloader.dll**  and press **Enter** . If it shows no results, go to **C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64**  instead and search **physxloader.dll**  again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc55648c21f8.jpg)
3. Copy the physxloader.dll  file if found and paste it into the **same location**   as where you copy the file in your problem computer.

**Note:**   Keep in mid that not every computer with the same system type has the dll file you want to restore, so this method is not always successful either.

### Pro Tip: Update your video driver

 An old, missing or corrupted driver might not cause this problem to occur, but it’ll cause problems to your video games, especially a wrong video driver. So we highly recommend keeping your drivers up-to-date for the best gaming experience.

 You can download the latest video driver from [official NVIDIA website](http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.17.0524-driver.html) .

 Or

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59c8cc9febab7.jpg)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to a flagged NVIDIA driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) –** you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59ca0cb183e6d.jpg)

Reboot your Windows and launch your game to see if it works.
