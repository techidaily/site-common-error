## **Solution 5: Disable the Third Party services**

 The issue can be caused by some of the Third-Party services. So disabling the Third Party services may fix the issue.

**IMPORTANT:** You need to use the keyboard or mouse on the problem computer to try this fix. If you can’t use one of them in Windows, restart it in[Safe Mode with Networking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then try.

 1) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.

 2) Type**msconfig** in the run box and click the **OK** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8db9a4f349.png)

 3) Go to the **Services** tab. Check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** then click**Disable all** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8dc3401983.png)

 4) Click the **OK** button.

 5) When you are prompted to restart your computer to apply the changes, click**Restart** . Then your computer will restart.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8dca75f671.png)

 If the issue resolves after the computer starts, you can try disabling the third-party services one by one to determine which service is causing the issue.

## **Solution 6: Enable Legacy USB Support in BIOS**

 The issue would occur if Legacy USB Support is disabled in BIOS. So enter BIOS (basic input/output system ) and make sure the Legacy USB Support is enabled. The key command to enter BIOS and get to the Legacy USB port depends on the PC brand that you are using. Refer steps below to get to the Legacy USB port.

 1) Enter BIOS (See[How to Enter BIOS in Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 2) In BIOS, use the specific key to navigate to**Advanced** (You can see the meaning of the key command at the bottom of the screen.).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8d3383654c.jpg)

 3) Find Legacy USB Support or a similar USB option. If it is**Disabled** , enable it. Exit after saving the changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8d4218d51d.jpg)

 Note if you don’t find  Legacy USB Support in BIOS, it is possible that the BIOS does not provide this option and this solution does not work for you. If you are still not sure how to do this, contact the PC manufacturer for further assistance.

 Hope the solutions here help you fix the mouse and keyboard not working issue in Windows 7.
