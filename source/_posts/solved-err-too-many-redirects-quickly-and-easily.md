### **Step 2: Make sure all the devices are within detected range**

 As mentioned, AirDrop works based on WiFi and Bluetooth, so your devices must be within the WiFi and Bluetooth range to be able to detected. You can’t AirDrop to users who are out of the defined range.

 It’s recommended to be as**closer** as possible when using AirDrop, and do not beyond**20 feet** (**6 meters** ), which may make your device undiscoverable.

### **Step 3: Turn off your AirPlane mode**

 The Airplane mode cuts off your iPhone’s connection to all wireless networks, both cellular and Wi-Fi, so your AirDrop won’t be working if your AirPlane mode is on.

 1)**Swipe** **up** from the bottom of your device screen.

 2) Tap the**Airplane** button to turn it off. The button is grey if it’s turned off.

## **Method 6: Check the WiFi network**

 WiFi network is an important factor to have AirDrop to be working. Check your WiFi network by these steps:

### **Step 1: Make sure your WiFi works properly**

 If your WiFi is not working properly, it may prevent AirDrop from working properly. You can**check your WiFi network on other device** , or**search something on your browser** to see if it works normally.

If it doesn’t work well, try another WiFi then.

### **Step 2: Make sure the devices are in the same network**

 Please make sure that your iOS devices and Mac that are using AirDrop are in the**same WiFi network** , and that can help solve the problem, too.

### **Step 3: Reset network settings**

You can try to reset your network to fix AirDrop not working.

**Note** : Resetting your network means that all the saved network settings will be erased, so please make sure you remember your WiFi network passwords. And you will need to enter your WiFi passwords after restarting your device.
