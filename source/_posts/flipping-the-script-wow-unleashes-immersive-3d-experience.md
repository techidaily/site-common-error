### Method 1: Reinstall the NVIDIA drivers

 The “GeForce Experience unable to retrieve settings” problem is probably caused by the corrupted driver files that simple uninstallation can’t get rid of. You need to clear all the files before you install the new driver. A clean reinstall may help you solve the problem.  

 The Display Driver Uninstaller is a driver removal utility that can help you completely uninstall NVIDIA graphics card drivers without leaving leftovers behind.  
 If you already have Display Driver Uninstaller, you can use it to uninstall drivers. Or you can use Device Manager to uninstall drivers.

1. Launch **Display Driver Uninstaller** . Choose the Safe Mode as it suggested.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ddu1.jpg)
2. Select the driver you want to uninstall then choose**Clean and restart (Highly recommended)** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DDU.jpg)
3. Wait for the uninstall to complete and restart your PC.

 There are two ways you can update your NVIDIA graphics adapter:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1–Manually download and install your driver manually

1. Go to the[NVIDIA official website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) to download the latest graphics driver for your device.
2. After installation, restart your PC and then launch GeForce Experience to check if the error message will appear or not.

#### Option 2–Automatically update your NVIDIA graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You can save more time rather than searching and downloading the right driver.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2** clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/geoforce1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

(This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/geoforce.jpg)
4. Run the GeForce Experience to check if this fixes your problem.

**Note** : After reinstalling GeForce Experience, you have to rescan to get the settings.

### Method 2: Reinstalling GeForce Experience

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/n0-1.jpg)

3. Restart your PC and then install the latest[GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) .
4. Run the program to check the error message will appear or not.

### Method 3: Disable your Bitdefender antivirus software

 If you have Bitdefender installed on your PC, you may have to stop it. It is because this antivirus software may block your GeForce Experience program and lead the GFE couldn’t retrieve game settings. You can simply disable the Bitdefender to see whether GFE can retrieve and optimize the game.

 If it does work, you may replace the antivirus software or ask the manufacturer’s customer service for help.  
 If this method doesn’t work, you can move to the next solution.

**Note** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Method 4: Deleting Steam User Data

 If you have Steam and you meet the error message, you can try this method to solve the problem.  
 You may have heard that Steam and GeForce Experience are not getting along very well, and this may lead to the problem. So deleting some of Steam’s temporary user data may resolve the problem.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**E** together to open the file explorer.
2. Located to this folder “**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata** ” and delete the folder without any number in its name. For example, “anonymous”. The folder name can be different.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/steam.jpg)
3. Restart your computer and run GeForce Experience to check if the error message is resolved.
