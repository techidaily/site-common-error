### **Method 1: Try the keyboard on another computer**

### **Method 2: Check if the keyboard is connected correctly**

 The error may be caused by a loose connection, so you can try checking the connection.  
 If you are using a USB keyboard, try unplugging it then plugging it back in.
 If you are using a wireless keyboard, try troubleshooting the wireless connection.

---

### **Method 3: Plug the keyboard to another USB port** (for USB keyboard only)

 The USB port that you are using may be having problem. Try plugging the keyboard to another USB port and see if the error persists.

---

#### **Method 4: Check keyboard batteries and wireless adapters** (for wireless keyboard only)

 If you are using a wireless keyboard, check and see if the batteries are down. Check if the keyboard is close enough to the wireless receiver. You need to make sure the keyboard is within 30 centimeters (1 foot) of the receiver. And make sure the wireless receiver is not being blocked.

**IMPORTANT** : Following methods need you to perform on Windows. Since the keyboard is not working, use a mouse to do the fixes.
