Ensure that there is no**objects (such as a wireless router or a microwave oven)** or**USB or wireless devices (such as a headset or a flash drive)** that may interfere in the connection.

**2)** Check the**battery status** of your controller: Make sure the **batteries are not running out of power** . If your controller is running low on power, charge or replace the batteries and see if this resolves the problem.

## Method 2: Re-sync your controller

**1)**  Press the**connect** button on your console.
