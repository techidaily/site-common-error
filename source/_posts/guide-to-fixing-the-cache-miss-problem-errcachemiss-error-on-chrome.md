5)**Save**your changes, and reboot your computer. This should fix your problem.

## **Solution 3: Update your drivers**

The driver problem can also cause the error 0xc00000e9, because the hardware can’t communicate with the software if there’s something wrong with drivers. You should **verify that all your devices have the right and latest drivers and update those that don’t**.

**Note** : Before updating drivers, you should boot your computer in**Safe Mode with Network** . (You can check this article for more information about **[how to enter Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .)

**Manual driver update**– You can update your drivers manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website**and searching for the**most recent correct driver**. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .**Automatic driver update**– Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE**or the**Pro**version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee**): 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/img_5aaf6cdfc84d7.png)3) Click the**Update**button next to all flagged devices to automatically download and install the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE**version). Or click**Update All**to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All**).

## **Solution 4: Run a disk check**

The error 0xc00000e9 can be caused by the disk problem. You should make sure that your disk works properly. 1) Boot your computer into**Safe Mode**. (You can check this article for more information about **[how to enter Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .) 2) In the search box on your desktop, type**cmd**. Then right click**Command Prompt** (right click cmd if you’re using Windows 7) and click**Run as administrator**. Then click**Yes**to confirm.

3) Type**chkdsk /f /r**, then press**Enter**on your keyboard.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59ad2ce110f69.png)4） Press**Y**on your keyboard.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59ad2cf3b0dde.png)

**Note** : Disk check will start the next time you boot your PC and it might take some time to complete. If you don’t have time to wait for the disk check to complete when restarting your computer, you can skip it or schedule it again.

## **Solution 5: Fix the MBR with Windows PE**

The error 0xc00000e9 can occur when you install Windows without setting the Master Boot Record (MBR), so you should set your C drive as the MBR to fix 0xc00000e9.

**Note** : This is a complicated and difficult process. You should attempt it only if you’re confident in your computer skills.

1) Connect the**hard drive**or**external drive**with the**Windows PE**to your computer. 2) Launch Windows PE, and**set your C drive as your Master Boot Record**. 3)**Reboot**your computer to reinstall Windows to see if the problem is solved. That’s all there is to it. Hope the solutions help you through. If you have any idea, feel free to comment below and let us know.
