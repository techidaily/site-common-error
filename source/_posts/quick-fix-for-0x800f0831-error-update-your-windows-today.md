## 1\. Manually download the update

 A manual download of the Windows updates is actually quite easy to do, especially if you know some basic computer tech. So if you see errors with Windows updates, the first thing you should do is to find the installation file for these updates and then install them by yourself. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time to open Settings, then select**Windows Update** .

2. You then should see an update error message like this. Note down the name of the update patch, which starts with**KB** . In this screenshot, the name of the update patch is**KB5016688** .

3. Go to[**Microsoft Update Catalog**](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) , and type in the name of the Windows update (**KB5016688** in our case) that fails to install and hit**Search** .

## 2\. Run SFC and DISM

 If the manual installation doesn’t work to install the Windows update for you, there could be some corrupted or damaged system files in the way. Fortunately, there are two built-in tools that can help to identify and repair such bad system files. The whole process could take some time, and we suggest you don’t run any other programs when doing the tests. To run these tools:

### 2.1\. Scan corrupt files with System File Checker

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** at the same time to run Command Prompt as administrator.

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Checker will then scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

 4) After the scan, try the Windows update process again to see if the problem still persists. If so, move on to the next test:

### 2.2 Run dism.exe

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following commands and hit**Enter** after each line:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

2) When the process finishes:

* If the DISM tool gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** , reboot your computer, then open Command Prompt as administrator again (step 1) and run this command line instead:

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 When these tests are done, run your Windows update again to see if the update is downloaded and installed correctly.
