### Fix 5: Launch Steam from shortcut

 Another useful workaround to this **Steam-Store-not-loading** problem is to create a Steam shortcut to launch Steam. The original Steam application won’t be touched so you can run Steam from both. To do so:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam**  into the box and press **Enter**  .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4eb7602a8e8.png)

 2) Locate and right-click on **Steam.exe** and click**Create shortcut** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4ee2106c035.jpg)

 3) Right-click on**Steam – Shortcut** and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4ee233441bd.jpg)

 4) Under the**Shortcut** tab, leave**a space** at the end of the **Target** box, then copy and paste **\-no-cef-sandbox** .

 Click**Apply** \>**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4ebe97cff5c.jpg)

 5) Double-click on **Steam – Shortcut** to launch Steam. Hope Steam store runs properly this time.
