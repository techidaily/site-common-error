## Cause of USB Mouse Not Working

* **Hardware Damage**
* **Loss of Power Connection**
* **Outdated Mouse Driver**
* **Inappropriate surface**

## Try these fixes

 Here are 4 solutions you can try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way until your mouse works again.

1. [Check for hardware damage](#fix1)
2. [Replug your USB cable or USB receiver](#fix1)
3. [Restart your laptop](#fix3)
4. [Update your mouse driver](#fix4)

### Fix 1: Check for hardware damage

 The very first thing is to check if there’s anything cracked or missing. Check the surface of your mouse carefully and also clean it while you’re doing so.

 If it suddenly becomes sticky or silent when you click, it may be caused by a failure of the optical sensor, which suggests that the device is damaged.

 If you’re sure it’s caused by hardware damage, it’s time for a total replacement, rather than having them repaired, given their relatively low prices.

### Fix 2: Replug your USB cable or USB reciever

 If you’re using a wired mouse or a wireless USB mouse, when it’s not working, the first thing you can do is to check if your mouse is connected correctly to your laptop. You can try to plug your USB cable or USB receiver into the same USB port or a different one to check if it works.

1) Unplug your USB cable or USB receiver from your laptop.

### Fix 3: Restart your laptop

 Sometimes a simple restart can help you fix a lot of computer woes, including your mouse not working issue. So if after you reconnect your mouse to the laptop, it still keeps not working, restart your laptop, please. After getting into Windows, try your mouse to see if it works.

### Fix 4: Update your mouse driver

 If you’ve tried all of the basic troubleshooting methods but still failed to fix it, don’t be frustrated. Your USB mouse not working issue could be caused by an old, incompatible, or corrupted mouse driver.

 A driver is the software that works as a translator for your mouse and your system. Outdated, corrupt, or missing drivers can always cause you lots of nagging issues such as the mouse not working, the keyboard not responding, the game not launching, or crashing.

 To fix your USB mouse not working issue, you can try updating your mouse drivers.

 There are two ways you can update your mouse driver, manually and automatically.

#### Option 1:**Manual driver update**

 You can update your mouse driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your mouse, or your laptop manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows versions. In this way, you will need to check the updates for your devices one by one.

#### Option 2:**Automatic driver update**

 If you’re not comfortable playing with your mouse driver manually, you can, instead, do it**automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find all the available correct drivers, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your laptop and detect any problem drivers. Your mouse driver is no exception.
