Steam will move your PUBG files to that new folder. You can then check to see if this fixes your building texture issues.

### Method 3: Update your graphics driver

Your game may not be able to load the building texture properly if you’re not using a correct graphics driver or it’s out of date. You should update this driver to see if this fixes your issue. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . **Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ): **1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** . **2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_your graphics adapter_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it.
