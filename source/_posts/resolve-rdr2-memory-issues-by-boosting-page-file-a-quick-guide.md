![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_5a813a79d32bb.png)

 Many**Overwatch** players have reported that they’ve got an extremely frustrating issue with their game: When they are playing Overwatch, their screen suddenly goes back and their game crashes. Then an error pops up and tells them “**Your rendering device has been lost!** “

 If you’ve also got this error, you may be mad now. You can’t play your game. And you’re losing your SR because of this error. And you may be trying hard to find a solution.

 But don’t panic. It’s possible to fix this error. The following are methods you can try. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

##  Method 1: Closing background applications

 You may get the rendering device lost error because there are applications (e.g. TeamViewer) running in the background that are conflicting with Overwatch. You can check the applications running on your computer and disable them one by one to identify the one that causes the problem.

**Be careful!** Don’t turn off any program or process that are essential for your Windows.

##  Method 2: Reset the frequency settings of your hardware components

 Your game may crash because you have overclocked your CPU, GPU, or any other components. You should set their frequency/clock speed settings back to the default and see if this can fix your error.

 If resetting doesn’t work, you can try slightly underclocking your CPU. Lower the clock speed of your CPU a bit, and then check to see if your game runs fine.

##  Method 3: Make sure the SuperFetch service is enabled

 Windows SuperFetch is a component of Windows’ memory manager. You can’t play Overwatch with your SuperFetch turned off. You should check the status of this service and make sure it’s enabled. To do so:

**1)** Press the**Windows logo** key and**R** on your keyboard to open the**Run** dialog.

**2)** Type “ _**services** **.** **msc**_  ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

**3)** Check the**Status** of the service**Superfetch** and make sure it is**Running** .

##  Method 4: Update your device drivers

 Your rendering device lost error can also result from your device drivers on your computer, especially your graphics driver and chipset driver. You can try fixing the error by updating your drivers.
