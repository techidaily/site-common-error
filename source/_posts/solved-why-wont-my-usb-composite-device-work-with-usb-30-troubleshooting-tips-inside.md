### Fix 1: Check the version of your operating system

 Some people may forget to verify if their operating systems are compatible with the newly bought adapters. If that’s the case for you, then you should figure out the version of your operating system first.

#### For Windows operating system

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo Key**  and **R** at the same time to fire up the **Run** box. Type **msinfo32** and click **OK** .

 2) Here pops up the**System Information** window. In its left pane, click **System Summary** and you’ll see the basic information of your PC in the right. Take a note of the **OS Name** item that manifests the version of your system. For example, this is a screenshot of Windows 10 Pro.

#### For Mac operating system

 1) Click on the**Apple** icon in the top left corner of your computer screen. Then, select**About This Mac** .

 After figuring out the version of your operating system, now it’s time to determine whether it can get along well with your USB to HDMI adapter. Some adapters only support certain versions of operating systems. If you confirm that there’s no problem between your computer and the adapter, then please move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Check your USB port

 There’s a possibility that your USB port stops responding so the connection between your two devices also goes wrong. Check your USB port and see if it can work well. If so, move on to the fix below; otherwise you should connect your adapter to another port.

 If you intend to fix the problematic port by yourself, you may refer to this post written by Microsoft Support:

### Fix 3: Download & Install the latest driver

 Your USB to HDMI adapter may also stop working if its corresponding driver hasn’t been installed properly. In this scenario, you should try to download and install the latest driver at once.

 You can manually download the driver from the website of your adapter’s vendor (the site is often mentioned in the user manual). After that, install the driver and restart your PC for the changes to take effect. You’d better remove the adapter from your computer while performing a reboot.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your adapter driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy takes care of everything.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE**  or the **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ). Or if you just want to update the adapter driver for now, hit the**Update** button next to it.

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you have any problems when using Driver Easy to update your driver, please feel free to email us at**<support@drivereasy.com>** .

### Fix 4: Ask for technical support from the adapter’s vendor
