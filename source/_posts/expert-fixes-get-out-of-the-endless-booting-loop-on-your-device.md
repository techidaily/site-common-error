## Solution 2: Update the graphics card driver

 The computer keeps going to sleep issue can be caused by the faulty or outdated graphics card driver, especially if you have a high-end graphics card installed. To fix the problem, you can try to update the graphics card driver.

 If you don’t have the time to update the graphics card driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

## Solution 3: Disable the screen saver

 The screen saver is the utility built in Windows. It will be activated after a certain period of Windows inactivity. If the screen saver is set to blank, and the wait time is 5 minutes, it’ll look like your screen has turned off or gone to sleep mode. So you can disable the screen saver and see if the problem persists.

 You can follow the steps below to disable the screen saver. The steps depend on the Windows version your computer is running. We show the steps for Windows 10 and Windows 7 below.

**For Windows 10:**

1. Press`Win+R` (the Windows logo key and the R key) on your keyboard to bring up the Start menu.
2. Type**lock screen settings** in the search bar and select**Lock screen settings** .

## Solution 4: Change the System unattended sleep timeout to a longer time

 If the above solutions don’t work for you, you can try to set the System unattended sleep timeout to a longer time. The option is invisible in Windows by default. You need to edit the registry to make it visible first, then you can reset the period.

 **Firstly, edit the registry to make the System unattended sleep timeout option visible.**

 Modifying the registry incorrectly may cause serious system issues. Make sure you follow the steps carefully. Before you modify the registry, you can back it up first, so you can restore it if you want. See[How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. Open**Registry Editor** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c137510499e6.png)  
 1a) On your keyboard, press the`Win+R` (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the Run box.  
 1b) Type**`regedit`** and click**OK** . Then the Registry Editor window will pop up.
2. Navigate to the following directory:  
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0]  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1375973d736.jpg)
3. In the right pane, double-click on**Attributes** to modify it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1375d052d8f.jpg)
4. Change the**Value data** to**2** . The default Value data is probably 1\. Whatever the Value data is, just change it to 2.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1375fa5a5d3.png)
5. Click the**OK** button.

6. Exit the Registry Editor.

3. Click the **Change plan settings** under your selected power plan.  

 In my case, the selected settings is Balanced, so I click on Change plan settings next to it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c13765cde66b.jpg)
4. Click on**Change advanced power settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. Expand the entry**Sleep** , then expand the entry**System unattended sleep timeout** . The value for this setting will probably be set to 2 minutes –**change it to a longer time** , for example, 30 minutes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1376fc0269a.jpg)
6. Click**OK** to save the changes.
7. Check to see if the computer keeps going to sleep.
